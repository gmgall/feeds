      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Giving myself permission to be confidently incorrect&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Wed, 19 Apr 2023 19:30:00 CDT"&gt;19 Apr 2023, 7:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;div class="note"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          This is my 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; post for the &lt;a href="https://jibran.substack.com/p/100-day-creator-challenge"&gt;100-day writing challenge&lt;/a&gt; I’ve been participating in.
          As of publication, I have completed the challenge: publishing, without exception, at least 100 words every weekday for 100 days.
          When I started, I never really thought I would ever complete 100 of something so consistently, but here I am.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          If you’ve been reading, thanks for following along on this journey.
          Big thanks to Jibran el Bazi for putting this challenge on!
          Thanks as well to everyone who participated; it’s been so much fun writing alongside you, and your daily posts kept me motivated to stay committed to my own.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          I will continue to publish regularly, but for the next while, I’m going to go down to two posts a week.
          Daily posting is a big time commitment, and I’d like to put some of that time towards building out other parts of my gomesite, as well as some offline pursuits, especially since it’s &lt;a href="spring.html"&gt;finally warming up here&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        My little sister just told me how one time, in school, a kid in her class was just talking and kind of unthinkingly said something he probably shouldn’t have.
        In response, the teacher said something like, “wow, that really tells me a lot about what kind of person you are.”
        I understand the impulse to try to get the kid to think about what he says, but what a terrible way to do it!
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Treating minor mistakes as deep reflections of a kid’s character is not a healthy lesson to teach.
        It teaches them that their mistakes are a reflection of a bad essential nature.
        It teaches them that they need to watch everything they say, lest they accidentally reveal themselves to be a stupid or bad person.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I think I was similar to this kid in some ways when I was younger.
        I’ve always loved to talk a lot and I still do.
        As a kid, this lead me to regularly say some pretty stupid, wrong, and bad things.
        At some point, I think I became deeply embarassed of saying wrong things, and tried really hard to avoid it all the time.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        When you need to avoid being wrong, but you also want to talk all the time, you end up becoming very pedantic.
        I obsess over endless levels of nuance with almost any idea I have, because I hate the feeling of telling someone something I think and having them poke holes in it easily.
        In some cases, I’m probably more interested in having ideas that are difficult to refute (i.e., correct-sounding ones) than useful or accurate ones.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        The defensive level of nuance is especially present in my writing, which I was trained through school to approach adversarially.
        Whatever claim you make, think about what a devil’s advocate would say.
        I’m good at seeking out that extra layer of nuance, so wouldn’t I be remiss if I didn’t include it?
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I’ve &lt;a href="funny.html"&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt; about how I show less of my personality in my writing than I’d like.
        The biggest reason is probably because I get sidetracked with correctness, rather than being true to what I want to say.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        This writing challenge has already been a huge help in unblocking ideas that I wanted to talk about, but was hesitant to put into words.
        Going forward, I’d like to do a better job of feeling free to say things as I really think or feel them at a given moment in time, even if they’re somewhat “wrong” by some standard or another.
        Perhaps people will correct me with things I was already aware of; isn’t that something I can survive?
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Not everything needs to be defended with the maximum level of nuance.
        Some ideas will only ever be refined if we expose them to the criticism of others.
        Other ideas, strong and beautiful ones at that, can only ever be expressed through an imperfect vessel of imperfect words.
        Even something “wrong” can be used to express the truth.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Do you feel like you can be wrong?
        Have you been pedantic or defensively nuanced?
        Do you sometimes have to say the wrong thing before you can say the right thing?

      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;The spring melt&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Tue, 18 Apr 2023 22:30:00 CDT"&gt;18 Apr 2023, 10:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        A consistent theme in my writing on here has been the winter I’ve been living through, the span of which coincided closely with the 100-day writing challenge I’m doing.
        I felt a distinct change in the feel of the season about a month ago, close to when the equinox actually occurred.
        We were still covered in snow, and would continue to get snow for a couple more weeks, but the days were getting longer and brighter, and along with the shift to daylight time, the feeling of spring was already on the way.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Now we’ve actually reached the point where the temperatures are finally overtaking the big backlog of snow to melt.
        With all the melt draining away, I’m hoping to go see the river sometime near its crest.
        Everything’s super wet right now, but it’s already getting easier, little by little, to get outside and do things.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        As it gets warmer, my favorite thing is to notice the memories of past springs that come back.
        They’re activated by the particular feeling of the air on a given day, or by smells that get easier to detect in warmer air, especially that of water-logged earth.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;i&gt;Spring Flight&lt;/i&gt; by Charles Beck (&lt;a href="https://kaddatz-galleries.square.site/product/charles-beck-spring-flight-15-150/2548" target="_blank"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        During winter, with these physical memories unavailable, there are certain thoughts you just can’t think, until the spring comes and gently unblocks them.
        I think of the process as an “inner melt” that accompanies the exterior one.
        It’s a helpful reminder that you’re not always a unitary “complete self”, necessarily, but that there are aspects of your personality that move and flow with the seasons.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Winter is almost always something of an emotional battle in this climate.
        But I really do think it makes the arrival of spring feel that much more meaningful.
        I can’t imagine living somewhere where the seasons don’t really have distinct shapes, as pleasant as that might be.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        What is the weather like where you live?
        When did the spring start for you?
        Do you notice memories or internal changes that follow with the seasons?

      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Build your own website&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Mon, 17 Apr 2023 23:30:00 CDT"&gt;17 Apr 2023, 11:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        I was going to start this post by talking about social media, but I think most of us are pretty well aware of the ways social media sucks.
        I follow some social media, but I don’t really post much on large sites.
        There’s stuff I would like to share online (hence this blog), but social media feels alienating and vaguely threatening to me.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        In contrast, having my own website has been a joy.
        Building this website and participating on Ctrl-C Club has been a real experience of the magic of the internet for me.
        It’s so much fun to share things on my site and hear back from readers about their thoughts.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I also love having full creative control over my web presence here.
        There’s no social media site where I’d be able to have a profile page that looks like &lt;a href="/"&gt;my gomepage&lt;/a&gt;.
        And no matter how customizable they get, those sites are (of necessity) restricted to specific structures and formats: you can only post videos on YouTube; you can only post tweets on Twitter.*
        With your own website, the only limits are your imagination and your skills.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src="img/nightdrift.webp" width="660" height="444"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;a href="https://nightdrift.neocities.org/"&gt;Nightdrifter’s Lounge&lt;/a&gt; is just one example of the creative and awesome-looking sites people make on Neocities.
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        There’s a higher barrier to entry when making your own website, because it requires you to learn HTML at a bare minimum, probably CSS as well, and eventually, you might want to add Javascript or even server-side code to it.
        But it’s not hard to grasp the barest basics to get a site started, and once you have a start, you can learn as you go.
        A site can be updated any time, so your site grows and improves over time as a reflection of your own journey of learning.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        You don’t have to pay anything to start a website, either.
        Gomepage started on &lt;a href="https://ctrl-c.club/"&gt;Ctrl-C Club&lt;/a&gt;, which gives out free user profiles on a shared Linux machine, which include a &lt;code&gt;public_html&lt;/code&gt; directory you can use to publish a user page.
        There are a &lt;a href="https://tildeverse.org/members/"&gt;number of “tilde” servers&lt;/a&gt; that offer similar things.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        If you don’t want to log in through a command line, there are other ways to host a static site for free.
        &lt;a href="https://neocities.org/"&gt;Neocities&lt;/a&gt; is a great site, inspired by the classic web host GeoCities.
        This is probably one of the easiest ways out there to get your own website.
        I love browsing around and seeing the fun, often retro sites people are building on there.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        If you are familiar with git, the version control software, &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/"&gt;Cloudflare Pages&lt;/a&gt; both let you deploy a site automatically from files in a git repository, which is convenient.
        I’m sure there are plenty of other free options for hosting out there, but these are just the ones that come to me from memory.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Home-made personal websites take more time, effort, and attention than social media, and so they will likely never be as popular.
        But it means they draw a more intentional and engaged community of authors and users.
        No matter what the majority is doing, fun &amp;amp; interesting alternatives are out there, waiting for us.
        In the same way &lt;a href="regenerative.html"&gt;regenerative agriculture&lt;/a&gt; eschews raw efficiency for ecological resilience and diversity, having your own website is like building a digital homestead (or be as it may, a “gomestead”) that supports a healthier online ecosystem.
        Come join us!
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Do you have a currently active personal site?
        Have you tried making a website before?
        Do you want to try making one?
        Let me know your thoughts at my Ctrl-C email: &lt;code&gt;gome&lt;span&gt; ​&lt;/span&gt;@&lt;span&gt; ​&lt;/span&gt;ctrl-c.club&lt;/code&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="footnote"&gt;
        * I know neither of these are perfect examples. On YouTube, you can now also make community posts, and Twitter in particular does allow some rudimentary forms of user-created structure with threading and quote-tweeting. But in either case, the format of the content will always be restricted to what features those sites have created.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
