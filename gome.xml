      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;I’m putting on a Jam&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Thu, 6 Jul 2023 22:30:00 CDT"&gt;6 Jul 2023, 10:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p class="note"&gt;
        Link to the Jam:
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a class="library-link" href="../library/webjam"&gt;
        &lt;svg width="24" height="24" class="icon stop-2"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Ctrl-C Webpage Jam&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Build on your user site!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        It’s been a little while since I last posted.
        Over the last month, I spent some time putting together my &lt;a href="../library/journal-index.html"&gt;journal index&lt;/a&gt;, which categorizes my posts up to now.
        Hopefully, it will be a more personal &amp;amp; usable alternative to having a search feature for my posts.
        I’ve also been playing a lot of &lt;a href="exploration.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and having a blast with it.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        My occasion for writing today is an upcoming event I’m hosting for the &lt;a href="https://ctrl-c.club/"&gt;Ctrl-C&lt;/a&gt; server community.
        Ctrl-C has been a wonderful online home for me over the past year and a half.
        I love having this easy-going and friendly group of computer tinkerers to share a website with.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src="img/neo.webp" width="785" height="416"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;~&lt;a href="https://ctrl-c.club/~neo"&gt;neo&lt;/a&gt;’s Ctrl-C site&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Ctrl-C is just one of a constellation of “&lt;a href="https://tildeverse.org/"&gt;tilde servers&lt;/a&gt;”, public Unix servers that give away free shell accounts to users.
        The first contemporary tilde server was started by a guy named Paul Ford in 2014.
        In his &lt;a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; describing the founding of &lt;a href="http://tilde.club/"&gt;tilde.club&lt;/a&gt;, he has a great paragraph about what he loves about the project:
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
        I’d taken this thing on myself and was paying to keep it going. But look at it another way: I was getting paid in web pages. I am a man who loves web pages. Not an activity feed, not structured tweets or organized blog posts, no brand messages, just pure raw weird signal. Like walking down a street in a new city at night and seeing all the signs, blinking and bright and in languages you don’t quite understand.
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        This is the best description I’ve found of what personally appeals to me about Ctrl-C.
        I love the creative potential of web pages, and I love to see people expressing their own personal flare with the medium.
        Gomepage is my own serious attempt to create a webpage as personal expression.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I’ve seen some great user pages on Ctrl-C.
        There are too many to name, but just a few I find especially fun include ~&lt;a href="https://ctrl-c.club/~pgadey"&gt;pgadey&lt;/a&gt;, ~&lt;a href="https://ctrl-c.club/~neo"&gt;neo&lt;/a&gt;, and ~&lt;a href="https://ctrl-c.club/~megymagy"&gt;megymagy&lt;/a&gt;.
        But I want more.
        I want more novel HTML creations, especially from some of the many users who simply have a “Hello World”, “Coming Soon”, or “Under Construction” as their only sign of life.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        So with that in mind, I decided to put on an event to encourage the Ctrl-C I want to see.
        The details are available on the &lt;a href="../library/webjam"&gt;main page for the event&lt;/a&gt;.
        If you are a Ctrl-C user, I encourage you to join us and build something wonderful!
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        For a while now, I’ve wanted to make some durable contribution to the larger Ctrl-C community.
        I’m not as handy at scripting as some of the other users, and I usually abandon programming projects, so I haven’t managed to make a contribution of code.
        Maybe I’ll run this event annually, and that will be my way of helping build up the culture of this server.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Do you love reading personal web pages?
        Do you have a personal site of your own?
        Are you a member of a tilde server?
        Have you ever participated in a jam of any kind?
        Let me know your thoughts at my Ctrl-C email: &lt;code&gt;gome&lt;span&gt; ​&lt;/span&gt;@&lt;span&gt; ​&lt;/span&gt;ctrl-c.club&lt;/code&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;

    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Have you heard of paramotors?&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Thu, 8 Jun 2023 22:30:00 CDT"&gt;8 Jun 2023, 8:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;div class="note"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          After this post, I’m planning to stop posting for a while.
          Getting out of the routine of doing it daily, alongside others, has kind of taken the steam out of it for me.
          I don’t want to be posting half-heartedly twice a week; I’d rather take a break for now (perhaps the summer months) and then go back to daily posting later.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          I’ll keep updating other parts of the site from time to time, so you’ll still be hearing from me if you check back regularly.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Today I discovered this really cool one-person flight system called a paramotor.
        You wear a big motorized propeller on your back like a backpack, which gives you the thrust to get airborne.
        Then a parachute is attached behind that, which gives you control over your flight and descent.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Apparently there aren’t a ton of regulations on them in the US.
        The FAA classes them as an ultralight vehicle and therefore doesn’t require any licensing or registration to use one.
        That being said, you’d be taking a grave risk to pilot one without proper training.
        They’re not toys, and they take real knowledge and skill to fly.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src="img/paramotor.webp" width="600" height="338"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit: &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paramotor2.jpg#Licensing"&gt;Toni Castillo Quero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        That aside, the paramotor seems to have all the things you’d want in a personal flight system.
        You get to fly out in the open (not enclosed), you can glide just over the ground or high up in the air, and the whole system is light and relatively portable (at least when compared to a plane or helicopter).
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        The old futurist idea of personal flight was always a jetpack, which would have the advantage of being able to take off from a static position.
        A paramotor requires a bit of runway to get up and down, and also takes up a little more airspace due to the parachute.
        But I don’t really see how a jetpack is meant to achieve stability, which the paramotor seems to manage quite well due to the parachute, provided weather conditions are safe.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Of course when I saw these, I immediately wished I could try one.
        It seems like it’s a serious investment of time &amp;amp; money to learn how to pilot one of these safely, let alone acquire your own.
        But at the very least it makes me happy to know something like this is even possible.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Have you heard of paramotors?
        Have you tried paramotoring?
        What do you think of them?

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
