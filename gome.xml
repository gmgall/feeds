      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;I love being slow&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Fri, 3 Jan 2025 21:30:00 CST"&gt;3 Jan. 2025, 9:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        When I was a kid and my parents were trying to take me anywhere,
        I was often a huge hassle because I just could not be rushed.
        I would get ready in the same unhurried fashion, regardless of the urgency of the situation.
        I’d always take forever to tie my shoes.
        As an adult, I can just imagine how annoying this probably was for my parents.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I’ve never really managed to break the habit, either.
        I now have two modes for getting ready to go somewhere:
        my customary easy pace, or a panic-induced rush if I’m really late.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        My rushing isn’t even particularly effective:
        I still usually end up wasting time, e.g., looking for something I need just before I get out the door.
        It’s just that I’m also stressed about it the whole time.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Despite the trouble it causes me in time-sensitive situations,
        I’ve come to realize that I really enjoy my slow pace when I can afford it.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        I am someone who needs time to process things internally.
        I often fall into a bad pattern with this where my mind is racing,
        trying to process all sorts of things,
        while I’m also trying to do things in the real world at a normal pace.
        My rushing mind causes me to pay less attention, or even worse, causes me to physically rush,
        and I get less effective at both the thinking and the doing.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        But there’s another way, where I give myself the space to do things at a more comfortable speed for me,
        and I find it to be really luxurious.
        If I go slowly, there’s room for me to reflect and process,
        and at the same time I can focus on what I’m doing,
        without feeling inattentive, pressured, or rushed.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        The funny thing is that my rushed flailing creates more friction,
        so it’s the “slower” way, where I intentionally and mindfully take my time,
        that ends up being faster.
        It reminds me of the saying “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Are you particuarly fast or slow by nature?
        Do you ever intentionally go faster or slower?
        Do your thoughts affect how fast or slow you tend to go?
        Have you ever learned a particularly challenging or rewarding tabletop game?

      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;I learned American mahjong&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Thu, 2 Jan 2025 22:30:00 CST"&gt;2 Jan. 2025, 10:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p class="note"&gt;
        I didn’t write much on gomepage in 2024,
        so this is the first of some posts I’ll do on things I did last year that are worth mentioning.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        If you tell someone you play mahjong, the first thing they will usually say is “oh, is that like the computer game?”.
        I, too, knew only of the Windows tile-matching version of the game when I began my mahjong journey.
        With no more knowledge than that, last May I signed up for a community education class that promised to teach the game.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        As I soon found out, mahjong is actually a variety of games using the same set of tiles, originating from China.
        There are variations across China and the rest of East Asia.
        There’s also an American version, the version we learned in my class.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/mahjong.webp" width="550" height="310"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Rather than a single-player matching game, American mahjong (like the original Chinese game) is a four-player game somewhat like rummy on steroids.
        Players draw and discard tiles in an attempt to create a winning hand of fourteen tiles.
        There are seventy or so patterns that describe winning hands, given in a terse notation on a printed card, and these patterns change each year.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Mahjong is definitely not an easy game.
        Learning so many patterns is difficult,
        but figuring out how to match up your current hand to the best possible winning hand is even harder.
        On top of that, even if you puzzle it out and hit upon something promising,
        it’s possible your luck will just be crummy and you won’t be able to get the tiles you need.
        One of the most remarkable things about mahjong to me is how it manages to be both so difficult and so luck-based at the same time.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        That being said, I find it a lot of fun to play.
        There are parts that take a lot of focus and thinking,
        but then there are parts where once you have a handle on what’s going on,
        you can mostly turn your brain off and play.
        It’s also just fun to handle the tiles, and they all have cool art on them.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        After taking the class, I went to a local weekly meetup to play the game some more,
        but didn’t get in a regular habit of coming.
        For Christmas, my parents got me my own set of mahjong tiles,
        so now I can host my own games with friends.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I had a lot of fun teaching my family to play.
        It was funny how those who tried it out found it ridiculously hard the first few times they played,
        and then around their fifth game or so, it would click and they would start to enjoy it.
        I look forward to getting more people over their first five games of mahjong.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Have you played American mahjong?
        Have you played a different mahjong variant?
        Have you ever learned a particularly challenging or rewarding tabletop game?

      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Bingle&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Wed, 1 Jan 2024 22:30:00 CST"&gt;1 Jan. 2025, 10:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        I think I first heard this word in a cat meme or something.
        It’s a nice round six-letter word; it sounds fun and is easy to type.
        Phonetically, there are no long vowels, giving it a bit of a casual vibe, and ending with the syllabic /l/ moves it into playful territory.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        When programming, I often need a placeholder word, e.g., if I haven’t decided what to name a variable yet, or I need to print out a recognizable string for debugging, but it doesn’t matter what.
        I used to use whatever word first popped into my head for this purpose, or even just random keyboard mashing.
        I recall one time during a code review a co-worker caught a debugging statement of mine that just printed out the word “Gamecube”.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Over the last few years, I gradually converged on &lt;i&gt;bingle&lt;/i&gt; as my go-to placeholder word whenever I don’t know what to name something.
        On top of its nice phonetic qualities (which I find valuable even if I’m just reading a word in my head), it’s really easy to type on a standard keyboard layout.
        I have it so worked into my muscle memory at this point that I can just kind of let my hands fall on the keyboard and I’ll type it.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src="img/mister_bingle.webp" width="377" height="500"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apparently “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bingle"&gt;Mister Bingle&lt;/a&gt;” is a snowman character specific to New Orleans Christmas. There’s a way cooler picture of him on the linked page&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        When I was deciding what to post about today, I opened up my text editor and started &lt;a href="update.html"&gt;copying over the HTML&lt;/a&gt; for a new post, as usual.
        When it came time to replace the path to yesterday’s with one for today’s,
        I found my fingers reflexively reaching for a nice, comfy &lt;i&gt;bingle&lt;/i&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Normally, &lt;i&gt;bingle&lt;/i&gt; is ephemeral for me, quickly removed or replaced with some actual content.
        So I thought, just for today, why don’t I let &lt;i&gt;bingle&lt;/i&gt; itself, my nonsense word, actually &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the content?
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        This made me curious if &lt;i&gt;bingle&lt;/i&gt; truly is just a nonsense word or not, so I did a quick Wiktionary search.
        Apparently, &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bingle"&gt;it really is&lt;/a&gt; a word with a handful of niche meanings!
        It’s a hairstyle, a baseball term, and best of all, it’s used to mean a minor crash (like a fender bender) in Australia.
        The idea of getting in a vehicular collision and saying “oh no, I’ve had a bingle” is so funny to me. What a world.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Do you have a go-to word, when programming, typing, or writing?
        Is it nonsense or does it have a meaning?
        How did you settle upon it?

    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Songwriting journey&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Tue, 31 Dec 2024 21:30:00 CST"&gt;31 Dec. 2024, 9:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Earlier this year, my brother proposed an endeavor in which we would each write a song a week and show it to the other.
        We are both musicians, but neither of us has a lot of experience with writing proper “songs”, so to speak.
        Given that we both have a lot of love for various types of songwriting, we’ve talked before about wanting to develop our own songwriting skills.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I thought this sounded like a great idea, but logistically it hasn’t ended up happening yet.
        My brother got busy with some other important things in his life, and without a partner to share progress and “compete” with, I didn’t really have as much drive to go it alone.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Fortunately, I at least managed to write one song.
        The music for it takes inspiration from early Beatles music, especially &lt;i&gt;Nowhere Man&lt;/i&gt;.
        I intentionally tried to keep the music simple to keep my focus on the lyrics.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/carlos_gardel.webp" width="512" height="330"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Writing lyrics was definitely the less familiar process for me.
        I tried writing some in high school, but I was never very good at it, and I mostly stopped trying by college.
        Trying again now, I seem to have some better ideas about how to start, but I definitely wouldn’t call it easy for me.
        I think writing words that will fit well to a song is a whole different skill set than either music or prose.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        One problem I’ve written about before is my hesitancy to &lt;a href="spin-up.html"&gt;start learning new skills&lt;/a&gt;.
        Lyrics and songwriting fall into that category of new skills I find daunting to take up.
        Nonetheless, it’s something I’ve been telling myself I want to get better at for a while now.
        And there’s no other way to do it but to keep trying.
        Hopefully my brother and I will have a chance to restart our project sometime soon.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Have you attempted any song or lyric writing?
        Have you ever been unsure how to acquire a new skill?
        Have you ever tried to learn a new skill alongside another person like that?

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ctrl-c.club/~gome/journal/songwriting.html</guid></item><item><title>gome — goals pt. 3</title><link>https://ctrl-c.club/~gome/journal/goals-3.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;No new year’s resolutions this year&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Mon, 30 Dec 2024 22:00:00 CST"&gt;30 Dec. 2024, 10:00 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        When 2023 first rolled around, &lt;a href="goals.html"&gt;I set a lot of big goals&lt;/a&gt; for the year.
        I even had a fun little tracking technique using weekly pocket notebooks.
        After nine months, &lt;a href="goals-2.html"&gt;I had reverted to my baseline&lt;/a&gt; in a lot of ways, but there were some positive developments, overall.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        This year, I got in a conversation about new year’s resolutions,
        and I realized that while I like setting goals around this time of year,
        I don’t really feel like trying to commit myself to any audacious year-long endeavors.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/como_falls.webp" width="602" height="400"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Setting a goal for a whole year isn’t a completely impossible commitment,
        but I find that what I want to focus on in life changes a little more often than that.
        After a while, I question whether I can really keep it up the whole year, or I just forget about it eventually.
        In such cases, I can’t help but feel it would have been better to commit to a shorter time period and wrap the goal up with a sense of success.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        For example, the &lt;a href="challenge.html"&gt;100-post challenge&lt;/a&gt; was a big undertaking for me, and at the end I felt satisfied with what I had done.
        But that was only a five-month project.
        If I had said, “I’m going to write a blog post every weekday for a year”, I’m not so sure I would have kept it up.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Anyway, this might all just be rationalization, but I don’t think I’m slacking because of it.
        I have plenty of ideas for goals I want to set, but this year, I’m going to do them by seasons instead.
        So here are some of my goals for &lt;i&gt;this winter&lt;/i&gt;, specifically:
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;a regular exercise routine&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;host a singing-focused event&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;re-establish my posting habit on gomepage&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;finish a choral piece I’ve been working on&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;some other things I’m still fleshing out&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        At the spring equinox, I’ll do a check-in to see how these goals went, and I’ll try to set new ones for the spring.
        Hopefully the shortened scope will help me focus on these goals and make them feel more manageable.
      &lt;/p&gt;
        What are your new year’s resolutions?
        Do you set goals at a shorter cadence than yearly?

    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Why don’t I review my notes?&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Sun, 29 Dec 2024 22:00:00 CST"&gt;29 Dec. 2024, 10:00 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        I don’t think taking notes is a natural behavior for me.
        In my earlier school years, I generally wouldn't take any notes at all.
        After some classes where note-taking was a requirement, I started warming up to the practice a little more.
        My note-taking habits are still inconsistent and unsystematic, but by the end of college I was much better about them than when I started out.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        For me, the use in notes almost never lay in actually reviewing them.
        Just the act of taking notes during class was enough to improve my retention.
        I think taking notes requires me to pay closer attention than I otherwise would have, and needing to phrase things in my own terms helps me add structure to the concepts I learn.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src="img/notebooks_2.webp" width="403" height="512"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image credit: &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TAHIR_SHAH_NOTEBOOKS.jpg#Licensing"&gt;Tahir Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Nowadays, while I still do a lot of learning, I don’t take many notes for it (perhaps I should!).
        But I do still take notes in the form of writing down ideas I have and saving bookmarks of webpages I visit.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        A few years ago, around the time I joined Ctrl-C, I started a habit of bookmarking almost every site or article that I found interesting.
        This helps somewhat with what you might call “open tab syndrome”, because you can tell yourself you’ll come back to things later.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        But will you (“you” being me in this case)?
        I find myself very rarely looking back through either my bookmarks or my idea notes.
        If I do, I’m usually looking for something specific that I already remembered somewhat.
        That certainly has its uses, but I wonder if I’m missing out on a lot of great things I squirreled away and then forgot about.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        The problem is, looking up a specific note or bookmark feels urgent and relevant to the here and now, while reviewing all my notes in general mainly feels like a chore to me.
        On second thought, more than just being a chore, I kind of feel like I’ll be crushed by the sheer volume of backlog that I’d like to get to one day, that requires follow-up from me.
        I have just so many ideas and interests, and I can only really be interested in and committed to a few at a time.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        But I do believe that if I just sat down and went through a bit every day,
        I could get through a lot of the backlog pretty quickly.
        What’s even better, I think I could reorganize and flesh out a lot of my notes, so that I feel comfortable leaving them for a while and then coming back to them when I’m ready.
        When I put it that way, it sounds worth it just for the peace of mind.
      &lt;/p&gt;
        What are your note-taking habits like? Haphazard, or organized, or a little of both?
        Do you come back to your notes regularly or sporadically?

      &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;I want to start blogging again&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="Mon, 9 Sep 2024 22:30:00 CDT"&gt;9 Sept. 2024, 10:30 PM&lt;/time&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        This was the longest gap I’ve had in posts since starting my blog back in &lt;a href="ramen.html"&gt;September 2022&lt;/a&gt;.
        During that time I’ve done and thought a lot of things worth talking about, but for various reasons, I felt like I shouldn’t prioritize the blog for a while.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I’ve been less involved in Ctrl-C in general this year, too.
        But I still look back fondly on what I’ve done here, and the people I’ve met, and I miss being more active, chatting and corresponding.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I don’t like the idea of gomepage going generally dormant at this point.
        I still have ideas for things to add, and I really do enjoy taking pride in crafting my little corner of the tildeverse.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        What’s more, I miss blogging.
        I miss having to sit down every day and get at least something out into the world.
        Not every post I made was a winner, but I routinely wrote posts am still proud of today.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        I don’t have a similar outlet for writing anymore.
        I tried for a while to start a music blog with my real name on it, but I felt a lot more pressure to make it into something.
        With the low-stakes atmosphere of posting on gomepage, I feel free to explore topics and ideas I couldn’t with a more focused blog.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Horrifically dated meme that popped into my head while writing this. This will not be a regular occurrence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;The plan for now: Songbook&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        I added this section to my site a good while ago called “&lt;a href="../library/songbook"&gt;songbook&lt;/a&gt;”.
        My idea was to encourage myself to write more about the songs I love.
        It sat mostly half-finished for a year.
        This year, I wanted to complete it as part of the &lt;a href="../library/webjam"&gt;2024 webpage jam&lt;/a&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        But thus far, I haven’t followed through on my plan.
        So my first order of business in revitalizing gomepage is starting work on that.
        After that, I have an idea for a photo gallery, although I might put that on hold for a bit to re-establish a regular posting schedule.
      &lt;/p&gt;
        Have you ever restarted a blog or some other project after a long hiatus?
        What were the challenges with getting going again?
        Let me know your thoughts at my Ctrl-C email: &lt;code&gt;gome&lt;span&gt; ​&lt;/span&gt;@&lt;span&gt; ​&lt;/span&gt;ctrl-c.club&lt;/code&gt;.
      
    &lt;/article&gt;
