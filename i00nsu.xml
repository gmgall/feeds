			&lt;h2&gt; My words about this service&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; As the first few minutes testing and reading the docs, I would say: &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; I like the Unix style. &lt;br&gt; 
				I like this super cool feature of having access to a ssh account where I can use my minimal services from another machines that is not mine. &lt;br&gt; 
				I notice few errors, that can be temporary &lt;br&gt; 
				1. The Wiki is ( at this very precise moment in TIME ) off-line. &lt;br&gt; 
				2. The IRC server / address doesn't work, even trying from the shell they offer &lt;br&gt; 
				-  Maybe I will learn a bit more about Linux, while I don't really care about console games &lt;br&gt; 
				-  The Gemmi protocol looks something new and interesting!!! &lt;br&gt; 
				-  Their forum application for the shell is something new to me.. I like it too &lt;br&gt; 
				-  And while I was reading some stuff I was writting this stuff &lt;br&gt;
					- I can use GIT :D I just want to kiss this people lol &lt;br&gt; 
					- An then I start to read their FAQ &lt;br&gt; 
					- Oh FAQ this is GOOD ! &lt;br&gt; 
					- I can code almost every language and they use VIM &lt;br&gt; 
					- sadly the elinks browser don't really support javascript, or else I would never use X again! &lt;br&gt; 
					- Yeah, I will not use this server to any "criminal activity" or to store my own data.. &lt;br&gt; 
					- I will store this text.. I can write 1GB of text &lt;br&gt; 
					- This services will be super useful for the FREE Linux course I am preparing &lt;br&gt;
					- Yes yes, I am learning Linux and Teaching Linux. &lt;br&gt; 
					- The Course I am preparing is somewhat superficial. &lt;br&gt; 
					- Is like presenting a new car to someone who like cars. &lt;br&gt; 
					- I will not talk about technical theory.. &lt;br&gt; 
						First because I don't really know the technical parts of it &lt;br&gt; 
						Second because they just want to know how to use the car. 
				&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt; My Questions about this service&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; Don't blame me. They have a space for questions and I can always send them an email&lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; I am too lazy to do it right now, since right now I am focusing on creating a new post for this blog&lt;/p&gt; 

			&lt;p&gt; The 'Vim' editor is not really prepared to highlight code syntax. &lt;br&gt; 
			- Can I install plugins? &lt;br&gt; 
			- I see the server can use NodeJS &lt;br&gt; 
			- Oh my COC &lt;br&gt; 
			- That would cause the use of too much resources if all users use that plugin &lt;br&gt; 
			- Looks like an "old" PC/Laptop doing good work! 
		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt; Just because colors are all the same&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; Ctrl-C.club: hit that key-bind and change colors. &lt;br&gt; 
			I mean, I really love green, nature is full of green &lt;br&gt;
			but green and black only is kind of military style &lt;br&gt; 
			well, that's it. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
					&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt; 
					&lt;p&gt;if everything is "insecure" &lt;br&gt; 
					by the perspective of those who focus their will to break something else,
					&lt;br&gt; the problem isn't created by those who search for that content?
					&lt;/p&gt; 
					&lt;h5&gt; YOu cannot Win the Storm..&lt;h5&gt; 
							&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;if one day you tell me you are the storm, you didn't win, but make it bigger! &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Is Amazing!&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; this server is like the old Unix machines &lt;br&gt; 
			alot of people connected, a lot of services running and when you check the performance &lt;br&gt; 
			... is working super fine! &lt;br&gt;  
			REST, Postgres, MySQL, NodeJS and so on.. &lt;br&gt; 
			everything working at the same time and memory and CPU don't change a bit.. &lt;br&gt; 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
			&lt;big&gt; this is super cool, and the comment is super null &lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
			&lt;h1&gt;doesn't contain something really useful... &lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;!Don't Use JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; I really mean it &lt;br&gt; 
			Don't use it &lt;br&gt; 
			if You trust the website, block everything! &lt;br&gt; 
			if you don't trust the website, don't visit the site &lt;br&gt; 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt; 
			but try to not me paranoid &lt;br&gt; 
			since the machine will say to it self &lt;br&gt; 
			&lt;big&gt; is only an humanoid &lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
			and if the website is using &lt;b&gt; JavaScript&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
			maybe they are &lt;i&gt; BREAKING &lt;/i&gt; all the &lt;b&gt; privacy &lt;/b&gt; rules. &lt;br&gt;
			.... &lt;br&gt; 

			&lt;h1&gt; just ignore it - You need to trust to know who you can trust &lt;/h1&gt; 			&lt;p&gt;
			did I say maybe? &lt;br&gt; 
			I look to this gopher protocol and I get in Love &lt;br&gt; 
			Pure text, not Java or Script with it.. &lt;br&gt; 
			Looks like it uses some markdown principles on it &lt;br&gt; 
			I can use w3m ... &lt;br&gt; 
			&lt;big&gt; BEST WORLD WIDE INTERNET BROWSER OF ALL TIME &lt;/big&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Yellow Banana Party Lover&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; Don't ask me why or how, but lets say &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;hr&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; Ctrl-c.club is a group of people who really know alot about Linux. &lt;br&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Just a Simple Question about&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;h1&gt; Groups &lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;hr&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;It looks like groups forms them self's by "little" proprieties that differ from others.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In the perspective of the specialization, we can see how deep each detail of knowledge is. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Is always a new world, while all together represent ... "the subject" ... "the discipline" &lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;If all groups of one single "discipline" get together to put all their knowledge in one single place, all can learn together about everything they already know and about all other subsubjects, other considerations  &lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;hr&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sometimes groups create new groups, but in Time they all "work" together, since they are all focused in the same direction. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;And the question is: why did i made such question? &lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;/article&gt;

	</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ctrl-c.club/~i00nsu/post008.html</guid></item><item><title>We Don't Need Security but Functionality</title><link>https://ctrl-c.club/~i00nsu/post009.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did you read the title of this page? I hope you did, because I wish to talk about it. &lt;br&gt;
    Security in IT comes up into reality as a tool that aims to protect the unprotected. &lt;br&gt;
    Security in Society comes up into reality as a tool that aims to exploit the unprotected &lt;br&gt;
    Basic principles of behavior, shall be associated to all the ramifications of knowledge, which means, all business areas and non-business. Normally business exploit this vunerability for "good", while the domination and the concept of propriety can exploit it for "bad". Each security service should exploit to teach and to prevent, but if you see, for society, we need a different approach to hack it for good. Because security doesn't need to exist inside society but on it's limits. Security doesn't need to exploit anything, because between people is all about information that should go or not into the space zone, and what are the effects associated, what are the memories associated, what those mean, what conditions are they, how to deal with them, and in all of them, not a single punch was made, not a single bullet was used. Security should value their own knownledge so they are able to teach and become better, or else, security teachings just produce more insecurity!!! &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; but wait, if you need to teach how a bad guy think, be sure you teach to those who you know what intentions in this kind of information they have, because even the "good" can use tools that only the "bad" use, while the "bad" use all other tools that the "good" use, while in all levels of knowledge we learn the same idea: learn to control the self. While in teachnology the "self control" is associated to permissions to isolate interaction, not to destroy the applications that work fine without the criminal intentions that each can use to break anything else, because everything is insecure in society and in technology if there is an pre-intentional propose to create that instability, so if you understand what I mean, the security services should really pay attention to this little details of memory, where each application ( person ) can do with knowledge. &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; knowledge is power while the responsabilty associated is bigger &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ctrl-c.club/~i00nsu/post009.html</guid></item><item><title>Behaviors can change if the code change</title><link>https://ctrl-c.club/~i00nsu/post010.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; this is not a normal html page, since it doesn't follow the recommendations of the HTML Specs &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;code&gt; this code have no code and no code should have &lt;/code&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
  here is some padding to this element of this page that doesn't use css 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ctrl-c.club/~i00nsu/post010.html</guid></item><item><title>Flutuações informativas</title><link>https://ctrl-c.club/~i00nsu/post011.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt; A informação fluí&lt;/h1&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Tal como a electricidade flui, no Espaço e no Tempo. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Pouco interessa qual o conteúdo da informação que flui, &lt;br&gt;
    mas sim saber lidar com a expressão da informação. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      Os computadores processam informação sem fazerem uma única questão. &lt;br&gt;
      As questões sobre qualquer tipo de informação só existem em seres electricamente orgânicos. &lt;br&gt;
      Só em seres que também processam informação. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt; Problemáticas da Psicologia &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A Informação dentro do corpo que a processa: &lt;br&gt;
    Não é electricidade mas sim memórias e a relação das mesmas, isto é, via a capacidade de associar. &lt;br&gt;
    A base fundamental está na educação? Talvez não, mas sim na forma e no seu estilo. Não é uma questão estética, mas sim harmoniosa isto é, funcional. A relação de informação na educação, deveria dar prioridade à capacidade de interação em prol da colaboração que tem como principal objectivo a focalização na melhoria dos outros. &lt;br&gt;
    Caso assim fosse, os comportamentos das pessoas deixariam de potenciar a competitividade e a discriminação, como também a auto-exclusão, pois haveria a necessidade de integração. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As artes marciais por vezes oferecem este tipo de princípios, quando o mestre é bom ( responsável ), mas o desporto não. É pena, pois o desporto para funcionar de forma técnica necessita de produzir a constante motivação e integração do desportista. Os princípios de colaboração e entre-ajuda, deveriam estar também associados ao desporto, aos membros das várias ramificações da justiça, aos negócios como deveres cívicos da própria empresa como forma de destaque e auto promoção e a todos os grupos que desenvolvem algo em conjunto. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A competição quer encontrar quem é "o bom" e a colaboração quer encontrar "a solução". 
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt; A Expressão não é Criação &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Somente um apontador que refere a probabilidade existencial de algo que possivelmente se desconhece, ou que é falso, ou que é verdadeiro, ou que é especulatório, sendo que é sempre informação que ficará alocada no corpo que a sente, pois existe uma afinidade informativa, não racionalizada nem propriamente explicável do fluxo da informação, mas sempre directamente relacionada com a memória!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt; A língua e o SE (condicional) &lt;/h4&gt;
    1. Se fosse possível...&lt;br&gt;
    2. Se acontecer...&lt;br&gt;
    3. Se houver...&lt;br&gt;
    4. Se a condição não existisse? &lt;br&gt;
    Se a condição não existisse era impossível prever, era impossível aprender.
