&lt;p&gt;2023-03-25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Retro-grouch" is a facetious term I believe was originally meant pejoratively to denote a bike geek out of step with the current trend in new bicycle technology. Now I see it laughingly and affectionately adopted by many folks passionate about steel all-terrain bicycles, practical commuter accoutrements, and resistance to keeping up with new, useless, expensive bike technology 'innovations.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I favor just this kind of riding for a few reasons. It values tried and true tools and technology. We don't need to adopt hydraulic brakes, tubeless tires, and internal routing. These things are more expensive in the first place, and require new tools and specialized parts, and often expert level knowledge. Alternatively, classic bike setups can be understood reasonably by me, an amateur, through experimentation, how-to books and tutorials, and they use fairly universal swappable parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's the approach that many of us on the smol web happen to take already with our own computers, but I thought I'd consider the idea a bit more and see if the comparison can bring new ideas to fore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I'm interested in thinking through aspects of permacomputing and resisting consumer culture, I've been trying to think through what aspects of a retro-grouch approach to computing might mean, and does this overlap with some of the other thinking I see out there in discussions of ideas about permacomputing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the use of the word retro I am not implying using retro computers (which my mind places in the 80s), but rather 'tried and true' basics. Getting a bit more in the weeds, there is also the bike term ATB, originally a term that rivalled MTB / mountain biking but gradually fell away in the past few decades and has recently begun to make a comeback as a term in some smaller bike communities. ATB or all terrain biking is a term for the on-road/off-road, commute or travel, grocery haul or long distance ride bike. It's a bike that can do it all and has done it all. It needs to be sturdy, weather and road-resistant, but able to be laden down with supplies, and yet still comfortable. An ATB is not a vintage road bike, nor a racing bike or even a 'gravel racer.' It is a bike that can literally do it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my ideas on speculative aspects of a retro-grouch and ATB approach to computing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;parts should be basic, swappable &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;should work offline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the OS should be stable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;it should be repairable by its user&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;simplicity where it counts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;all the accoutrements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;seat, pedals, handlebars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;quality and longevity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Parts should be basic, swappable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could mean basic wired keyboards, usb hard drives, thumb drives, and likely a Linux distro operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Should work offline&lt;/h3&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;i.e. not a Chromebook or equivalent 'cloud'-reliant computer. That's not to say it can't have browsers or go online, but it should have capabilities and all basic programs available on the computer, without needing to pay for a subscription, commercial service or commercial software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;a stable OS &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By stable, I'm suggesting it should be a basic Linux or BSD distro that doesn't really need dotfiles or extensively studying documentation. It should not require constant updates, and at risk of starting an argument I'll suggest more than once a month being too much, as a start, and maybe shooting for twice a year is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;it should be repairable by its user&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user of this computer should be able to reasonably keep the working and running of the machine and its parts in their head so that they can fix an issue when it arises. And the documentation for how to do so should be available offline as well. When I purchased a CHIP computer about a decade ago, I was impressed that a simple easy-to-read PDF manual was placed in the home directory. You could start up and go without reading it, but if you did need to alter something or had to troubleshoot (such as a non-working DIP to connect a HDMI monitor), you could open up the manual and read about it without needing to go online. When reading about the DIP that's where I learned I likely had a power issue and needed to power the keyboard through a powered hub to free up power for the monitor connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;simplicity where it counts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everything else on this list, this particular facet can be debated extensively, but my main idea here is that while the computer should be 'simple', I don't mean it should be command line only, or a minimalist distro per se. While that is no doubt a great approach for folks (like myself) interested in it, for those that just need to 'get around' the computer should be simple enough and no simpler! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have purposely not specified a single distro or family because I think this is really up to the individual. Just like how one may buy a custom Rivendell bike, a production Crust bike frame, or spec out separate parts to build up together, or revive a 1980s city bike for example, there are many approaches one can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;All the accoutrements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's where I mention bike bags, baskets, fenders, water bottle holders, good tires and tools. On the computer we need text editors, file manager, spreadsheet, calendar, word processor, layout software, music software, image editor, some games and anything else one may want. A WMDE (window manager / desktop environment) can obviously come with this on some distros, or one has to add them on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, each person can individually tailor their own computer, and will have their own needs and preferences. Like there are fixed gear riders and fat tire bikes, there is Damn Small Linux on an old eee PC or running Void on an a desktop Alienware. Sorry, maybe these are silly comparisons! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Seat, pedals, handlebar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to consider the retro-grouch approach to biking one thing I sometimes see emphasized is where the user comes into contact points with the bike: seat, pedals, handlebar. By the same token, this is where we consider practicality, aesthetics, and function for our computers as well. The interface of the machine is important, impacting our comfort. I'm talking about the mouse, keyboard and seat. On the one hand there are the mechanical keyboard addicts, and on the other, those happy to use the generic keyboard that came with their machine. I like a trackpad and basic usb mouse, but I've also been happy with a trackball. All this is in opposition to the expensive and finicky touchscreen. I'm not totally against them, but I've yet to see them work really well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Quality and longevity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've not specified how long this machine should last. If the parts are made well-enough, capable of being replaced, basic, and simple, this should last a long time. With my XPS 13, it still feels snappy enough to me at 5 years old   that my only plan for right now is to fix a broken key. I ordered the part for $10 online. And I'm going to replace the battery, with one I bought online from the manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've left out discussing the monitor, but it should be obvious I doubt an ultra high definition monitor is necessary for computing. The monitor of several years ago should be just fine. For speakers, I just plug into my desk speakers, and that works fine as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have been reading this whole post and gotten down to the end and felt like this was all obvious stuff and what you're already doing. Hopefully so. And yet it's in stark contrast to the kinds of machines I mostly see advertised online, the computers sold by the mainstream brands, and especially our societal emphasis on the latest tech trends and consumption. The more we can normalize these kinds of values I think it's better, especially if we can reduce consumption, increase know-how and confidence in working on one's machine if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a machine like this, it may be worth acquiring one: used on Ebay, craigslist, from a university, or gathering dust on a shelf somewhere. This summer I'm thinking of building up a few of these in a small fleet for an informal co-working/hang space on Governor's Island in New York, with folks that are definitely not Linux users or knowledgeable of it. For one thing, it will be useful for folks in my community that need a space to work and some occasional computer use. For another, it can serve as a model for some folks of this kind of computing, and I can get some feedback from them on how useful it is and what its limitations may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023-03-14&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I return to chess and chess-likes every so often. Abstract board games keep my interest in the longhaul though there are sometimes many months that go by between playing them. For the past two years I had been on a Backgammon kick, playing with different friends and my partner and even online. Lately though I've been back on chess, and specifically some of the variants below. Short descriptions and biased anecdotal reviews below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using the term chess-like facetiously. In the wider world there is a known title "Chess Variant." This is a term for the family of games based on Chess, with different rules variations and sometimes completely different pieces, though often on a standard or enlarged regular gridded chessboard. By the way, one of my favorite chess variant terms is "fairy pieces," the term for a variant chess piece not found in the now-standardized classic chess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/view?Fairy+chess+piece"&gt;Fairy Chess piece (Gemipedia)  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece"&gt;Fairy Chess piece (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I've reviewed modern Chess-likes, as opposed to traditional chess variants. Whereas many chess variants are slight modifications to the game, they often eschew past knowledge, for example by studying openings, but preserve a similar focus on careful and methodical strategy. The chess-likes below I've selected because they more dramatically tend to change the gameplay, reimagining chess in completely new forms, or departing almost completely while retaining a bit of the flavor of chess. If we need a metaphor, and since I'm a puzzle videogame player, let's consider these games to be Broughlikes to Rogue's roguelike, if that metaphor means anything to you, rather than new "traditional oldschool roguelikes." Throwing out tradition while retaining some of that chess strategy flavor, that's perhaps a good way to think of these, though of course there is likely a continuum of games between chess and not-chess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a classic! It's a beautiful strategy game. In high school I read books on various opening and middlegame and even endgame strategies and spent hours refining my game. I still use some of those skills when I play, though I'm quite a bit rusty. I had chess puzzle game books and the like too. I didn't want to spend hours each day for years to continue to improve my game. I started getting more interested in making music, reading and other pursuits. In college I played with friends, and over the years have continued to play the game. I've tried online chess a bit when I was dating someone that was really into it, but now I tend not to play the game anymore. I've kind of lost my taste for it unfortunately. I think its slow deliberate nature was too plodding for me. I turned to speed chess games, which I enjoyed, but rarely have a friend in-person who wants to play this way. I tried it online but didn't enjoy it as much. Occasionally I'll play on my tablet or phone, and I genuinely enjoyed beating a 'young Magnus' in a Magnus chess engine, and took a commemorative polaroid when I beat the chess program of the PDP-12 (from 1969) I think it was at the Living Computers museum in Seattle. Still, chess will always be around, and I'm glad I know how to play, but it's just not a common game for me right now due to its high time commitment. And the desire for finding more casual ways to play are what brought me to these chess-likes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Knightmare Chess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a deck of cards that you use with a traditional chess board and pieces. It's published by Steve Jackson Games, from 1996, and based on an old chess card game variant from France that translates to 'Storm on the Chessboard.' Each player draws a hand of cards that they play along with the standard chess pieces. These cards add new rules, interrupts and transforms or builds fairy chess pieces. Honestly, Knightmare Chess is a chaotic game, possibly the most chaotic two player board game I've played. Just about 15 minutes into a game and I find with my partner the game is careening back and forth between the two of us. There's something satisfying about slapping down a card that cancels your opponents last move, sacrifices one of your pawns to kill a stronger enemy piece, or freeze an opponents piece, or lets you move twice. Then your opponent slaps down a card that reverses yours. Or.....You get the idea. This game has led to a lot of near-shouting when my partner and I play as you sometimes have to interpret rules and see which card cancels out which other which cancels out another, etc etc. It can be a lot of fun, but is kind of the exact opposite of classic chess, which continues at a slow moderate pace. Where that has no hidden information, this is tons of hidden information and randomness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several variations of Knightmare Chess listed in the rules booklet. I have the 2nd edition, which features 2 decks of cards. Rather than the deck-building version where each player builds up a deck to play from, like Magic the Gathering, I tend to play where we have a single deck of cards to draw from and each of us draw to keep 5 cards at the end of each turn. But this may also be why our games veer wildly back and forth. Don't get me wrong: there is plenty of strategy, but things go haywire quickly. I recommend it as a good way to have a high octane game. Games  play usually takes us up to two hours, but my partner takes really long turns as they study their cards over and over again, whereas I'm usually ready in a minute, so I'd think a typical game should take about an hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I think the graphics are atrociously bad and missed a great opportunity. Far from being nicely designed like Magic The Gathering or other modern deck-builders, this game has a vague 'dark dungeon' theme: think lightly colored dark lairs and mages and the like, but completely faded out color on the cards. It sort of works to advantage though to hide the at-times grotesque imagery. I think they missed a great opportunity to have images that help make clear the effects of the card. The text is also poorly aligned on some cards. Although this is slightly disappointing, it doesn't overall affect the gameplay so much as we are mostly just reading the text on the cards rather than admiring their design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/view?Knightmare%20Chess"&gt;Knigtmare Chess (Gemipedia)  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare_Chess"&gt;Knightmare Chess (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thrive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent game, from the past 5 years, described as something of a "Build Your Own Chess piece" game, created by Martin Grider for Adam's Apple Games. I met Martin at Eyeo conference a few years ago while he was seeking crowdfunding for the game. His blog and podcast is a good place to hear him talk about board game design and prototyping. Martin described the game to me and I was hooked. These were originally published online as print and play PDFs you could use online. Then the crowdfunding campaign came, which allowed a more refined designed board, pieces and packaging, and came with an expansion pack. There is also an iOS app to play as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://chesstris.com/"&gt;Chesstris, Martin Grider's blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Thrive each player starts with 5 plain pieces. Each turn you add some pegs to any two of your pieces. These pegs indicate new ways that your piece can jump on the next turn. If you add a peg to the right, you can use that piece to jump to the right. If you add a peg two to the front, it can now jump two spaces ahead. Add one diagonally back left and the piece can move diagonally back left. Each time you add a peg it keeps all the previous pegs, so your pieces get stronger and stronger so to speak. Or more accurately, they get more flexible. Like building a custom pawn-knight-bishop or something like that. Capture an enemy piece by landing on it. Capture enough of your opponent's pieces to get them down to one and you win. Games take about 25 minutes. The Pond Life expansion adds cards, some new gameplay variant rules, including the ability to play multiplayer. Mostly, these didn't capture my attention, and were less elegant than the original rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, while Thrive is fun, I haven't stuck with it as much as some of these other Chess-likes. When first playing the game, I loved the concept, and even the feel of the pieces, of plugging in new pegs to alter my pieces felt really good. But at the same time, there does feel like some amount of guesswork as you're learning strategy. A few games in you've got the strategy down somewhat and there's much less strategy than Chess. That's both a good thing, since it makes for a fast game, but also doesn't necessarily reward deeper play as much. Still, a recommended game, good for occasional game nights. While the game ships in a box, the fabric 'board' rolls up and the pieces slip into a bag that comes with the box, so you could make a more portable on-the-go setup, or do without the proper and print out print-and-play versions - which is what I did first to make sure I liked the game enough to want to order it. The theme of lotus flowers is lovely enough, but doesn't have a big impact on the enjoyment of the gameplay, and maybe connotes an idea of zen that isn't quite present in the gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adamsapplegames.com/thrive/"&gt;Thrive (Adam's Apple Games)  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adamsapplegames.com/product/thrive-print-and-play/"&gt;Thive Print and Play (for sale)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chess-like quite distinct from Chess. And there are two expansions. I have Hive Pocket, same as the original game, but smaller and comes with the expansions. The first obvious distinctions from Chess is that there is no separate board, and the pieces are hexagonal. The first few turns players add pieces to the table connected to one of their previous pieces. As you add more pieces, you are effectively building the board, and no piece is ever allowed to be on its own without touching an adjacent piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like chess, the pieces have distinct moves. The Queen is a bit like Chess's King. It can move one move at a time. There is the ant, which can shoot around the sides of pieces as far as it can go. The grasshopper leaps over a stack of tiles and lands on the opposite side, as long as there are no spaces between tiles, something like a jumping rook. A spider scurries along 3 spaces past other tile-pieces. The beetle moves like a queen in that it only moves along one space, but it is the only piece that can move on top of an adjacent piece, pinning it down (with its pincers?). Expansion pieces include Ladybug, Mosquito and Pillbug. For regular Hive, must buy these separately, but they come with the Pocket travel version of the game, which is the version I own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To win the game, trap your enemy's Queen by surrounding it completely, with a combination of your own and your opponent's tile pieces. Sounds easy enough, right? And games certainly are fast, usually about 15-20 minutes. Hilariously, as I searched online to confirm this time, I see the gameplay time listed drastically differently, everything from 10-20 minutes in some places to 60-75 minutes elsewhere. Gen42, makers of the game, list the time as 10+ minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some similarities to chess are that there is no hidden gameplay, no randomness, and there are deeper levels of strategy available to players studying the game. But unlike chess, gameplay is much faster because you have more far-moving pieces than weak ones. It's something like if Chess had more rooks and bishops than pawns. That combined with how you build the board together each time differently means there's not as much of a chance to develop 'openings' as such, and with all pieces touching from the beginning, there's not as much time needed to 'develop' pieces like chess. For these reasons, Hive is a great board game for those seeking a Chess-like experience without some of the bogged-down parts of the traditional game. The feel of the Hive pieces are nice in the hand, and the pocket version packs up small enough to travel well. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/view?Hive%20%28game%29"&gt;Hive (Gemipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)"&gt;Hive (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bosworth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally published in the 90s Bosworth is a 2-4 player chess variant. The board is a 6 by 6 grid, without using the 4 corner spaces. A player has 4 spaces next to them on the edge of the board, called a 'home camp.' Each player starts with 4 pawns in their home camp. At the beginning of the game, a deck of cards is shuffled and players draw 4 cards. Each time you move a piece out from your home camp you select a card from your hand to lay down to place in the empty space, then draw a new card for your hand. This is how you get your pieces onto the board and developed. If an opponent captures a piece in someone else's home camp it prevents the other player from being able to bring a new piece onto the board there, which is one particular strategy to follow. The pieces move pretty much the same as chess, with the exception of pawns, which can now move sideways too. Pieces capture like normal but there is no checkmate. Kings can instead just be captured. Kings can also capture one of their own side's pieces. When a player loses their king all of their pieces are removed from the game and the capturing opponent can add a queen to the board. Play proceeds til only one player is left standing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay is fairly fast, with games seeming to take about 30 minutes. The smaller board means that capturing comes sooner, and because of this knights, for example, appear even stronger than they are in Chess. The use of cards to determine what pieces you bring out adds just a bit of randomness to the game, which is enough to destabilize things so that one couldn't really prepare openings for example. While the cartoon chess piece cards have replaced the use of physical 3d pieces, I didn't mind as much as I thought I would, once the play got going. This would be a good game to get if you have a small group in mind to play with but didn't mind occasionally playing as a duo if you're looking for chess-like gameplay but a faster game. While the game seems designed for and plays best with 4 players, it can still be fun to play with 2 or even 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/view?Bosworth%20%28game%29"&gt;Bosworth (Gemipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosworth_(game)"&gt;Bosworth (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h2&gt;Hexapawn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't a game so much as a puzzle or teaching/learning tool. Originally created by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in 1962, this is an exercise to understand how we can train machines to play chess. I built my own Hexapawn game following the ideas in the article when I was a child using colored beads and empty matchboxes to build a chess-playing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main concept is that we have 3 pawns per color on a 3 by 3 (tic-tac-toe) grid. Players alternate turns moving a pawn forward or capturing diagonally. If a player reaches the last row or blocks their opponent from being able to move, they win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is designed to be used solo. When you beat the 'computer' player in a game of Hexapawn you remove a bead (or cross out its last move, whatever method you've used to decide the next move), so that it can't make that move the next time it plays. This removes options from the AI's 'game tree' and quickly 'trains' the AI to become a perfect player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/view?hexapawn"&gt;Hexapawn (Gemipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapawn"&gt;Hexapawn (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Solitaire chess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solitaire chess is a collection of chess puzzles on a 4 by 4 grid. You pick a card showing how to set up a few pieces, put those pieces on the small grid board, then proceed to capture chess pieces until only a single one remains. Each move you are required to make a capture. Pawns do not get promoted. There is no check. If more than one piece remains, you lose. If you're ever unable to make a capture, you also lose. The challenges are given ratings from medium to hard, and there are many of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an iOS app available but I bought the physical version at a thrift store several years ago. Personally, while I enjoy it as a diversion, I'd classify this more like a logic puzzle than a full-on game. I don't get the stimulation that comes from having another player surprise me. I'd say this is my least-played chess-like out of all the ones above that I own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thinkfun.com/products/brain-fitness-solitaire-chess/"&gt;Solitaire Chess, by Thinkfun games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Duke&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Duke is a strategy game clearly influenced by Chess where you draw tiles to play. At the end of each turn you flip your tile over to reveal a new fairy piece to play on your next turn. If you land on an opponent piece you capture it. Capture your opponent's duke to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over a dozen potential pieces to be played, as well as many expansions to add new pieces and rules variations. From my recollection, it has some of the flavor of Thrive with the fairy-piece and randomly popping up new pieces feel of Knightmare Chess. Unfortunantely, I've played this game only once, and and I couldn't get enough flavor from just the single playthrough. Though it seems well-loved online. I'll need to try this one again sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Quick Chess and No Stress Chess&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are promoted as a chess learning aid for kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick Chess is played on a cut-down chess board 6x5. I played this a few times, over a decade ago, so my memory isn't that fresh. I remember it being a quick chess variant that mostly feels like the 'real game.' My memory may be rusty because in this YouTube tutorial it says the goal is to get a pawn to advance to the 6th rank, or capture all enemy pieces to win. Because this variant isn't that different from Chess, and doesn't offer that much new gameplay I would probably skip this one. No Stress Chess is played on a standard board, but in this game, you draw cards and then play a piece based on a card you play. I've never played, so I have no idea if this is fun for folks with previous chess experience. I can imagine not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023-03-11&lt;/p&gt;

*Links can be found below post*

&lt;p&gt;If you hang around on nerdy Linux boards, tilde communities and the like for long at some point you'll see a reference to Vim, emacs, probably Neovim, i3, and what other acronyms? fzf is one I see a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fzf is a "command-line fuzzy finder" by junegunn, and it's well-loved for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works as an executable binary as well as embedded within tmux; with key bindings in the shell in Bash, Fish, and Zsh; as a Neo/Vim plugin. It's also easy to install and is available in the package repositories for a large number of Linux distros as well as Homebrew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I haven't used it nearly as much as many other people do. But recently while reading the community bulletin board called "iris" that is private for members of the Ctrl-C Club tilde server community I read this intriguing little comment from someone who built a tool for searching and navigating through old message threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said that they had been looking for a way of building TUIs (text user interfaces) for shell scripts, and at first had considered using dialog, a very old program that makes use of the Curses library. But this person then found fzf very convenient because it let them build TUIs quickly, just by piping the options into fzf and saving the reply as a variable. They said they used it as a replacement for menus, yes/no boxes, lists, checklists (when using --multi option).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of those newer to working on the command line, a Command Line Interface and Text User Interface are not the same thing. I think of the command line as the interactive text parser you interact with by giving a single line of text and hitting enter. You (usually) get text output, some text printed to the screen for example. Then you write another line, see its output, and continue refining and directing your experience this way. A TUI on the other hand is an interface 'between' the command line interface and a full-fledged graphical user interface. They may use color, characters that approximate a visual interface element (like using text lines to draw a border around a box), and the use of indicators like a pointer to show a user what has been selected. They may look like simple GUIs, but they're usually quite fast, often allow key-driven action, and they let the user stay in the Terminal without launching a new program. Examples of common TUI programs are Midnight Commander, a file manager, and Nano or Vim, text editors with light TUIs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I previously was looking for simple ways of making a TUI I had come across Bubbletea, a Go library that makes beautiful TUI programs. I'm not interested in pursuing Go and haven't come across any other libraries with some of the advanced features built into it. But I tried several other approaches: using the dialog library, with curses, or coding in a language with curses bindings. I have also tried manually approaching the task of creating a TUI menu by using `select` and looping through to parse user input for example. Recently I also found a thread with multiple answers on ASkUbuntu.com with some of these solutions and others such as using ANSI escape codes to color text, and other Bash script approaches. No doubt this can work for some folks, but I found the idea of using fzf to easily make selectable TUI menus really intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, it was quick, fairly easy to use this system - summarized as fzf to select, output saved to a variable, which we then interpret. When using fzf you can press up or down (no vim-keys) to navigate through the menu options, or press the number of the entry number, or start typing other text in the menu item and hit enter to open it. To go "back" to the start of the menu, you delete your text. Exit out by pressing cancel, selecting Quit, or Ctrl-C. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing fzf, try it out by running fzf in your terminal. You'll have a simple file selector. This will let you check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;fzf code snippets for starter TUI menus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the previous in mind, here's my own attempts at creating some simple basic starter snippets. More advanced usage can be found in the fzf wiki and other links at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise stated, these are written in fishscript for fish shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Minimal example: a simple yes/no dialog selector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;fish
set INPUT $(echo -e "yes \nno" | fzf)

if [ $INPUT = "yes" ] ;
  echo "yes it is" # do YES
else
  echo "no it's not" #do NO
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanation: You are printing yes and no, delimited with a newline \n, the default for fzf. This is getting piped into fzf, which renders a simple default 2 line menu, and saves the output of whichever is selected to the variable INPUT. You can then process this and perform an action, possibly with an if conditional, as demonstrated, or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fzf has a number of styling options available, including border options (rounded, anyone?). To be honest, I'm relatively new to fzf and am likely underutilizing and understyling it now. Check out some of the articles and example programs with fzf below to learn better ways to use it in your shell scripts to make TUI menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Basic menu example: A recipe browser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic script I use for accessing my recipes on my computer in a directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# run this inside the recipe directory
ls | fzf --header"Use CTRL-C to cancel" --reverse --preview="cat {}"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I list the full path to the directory and pass in all of the recipes (txt files) in that directory to fzf, specifying a header, and to list the recipes in reverse (A-Z) and using cat to print out the contents of each recipe as I navigate through the folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Lettuce!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick message to say thank you for this post on your gemlog.  I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;heard about fzf a long time ago but, a bit like you, I had never found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a useful function of it; well, on that suits me in my own workflow,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;should I say.  But your example for the recipes made me wondered.  I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;installed it and tried.  I found it amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not a TUI person.  Apart from pamix(1) I don't use TUIs at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have to say that I'll now use your example to browse my own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recipes.  And, maybe, I could tweak it for some things else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No thank to you for digging me in fzf rabbit hole :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you the best.  Take care :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing this! About a dozen years ago I built a little app using PHP, jQuery, and SQLite that runs in my&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;web browser to track my daily expenses.  In recent years I spend less and less time in a desktop environment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;working more often in the Linux console. I've wanted to migrate my app but didn't want to figure out how to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ncurses and\or dialog plus possibly PHP or nodeJS or some other scripting language to put all the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long had fzf installed on all my machines but had never really learned to use it, it was just a quirky little&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;file finder and Ranger works so much better for me (largely because I took the time to learn to use it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your post about using fzf to build a TUI was just what I needed. The very next day I built a bash + fzf + SQLite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;version of the app that works great on the various machines I've got laying around here. SyncThing keeps the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;database synced between them all and I have my data everywhere I need it -- including that I can still use the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;original web-based version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023-03-08&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I've been getting increasingly reliant on a small corner of Gemini: the utilities by Acidus available at gemi.dev&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev"&gt;Gemi.dev Heavy Industries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them are built around the idea of proxying http content to Gemini. For example, Wikipedia via Gemini:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi"&gt;Gemipedia &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or reading one of hundreds (thousands?) of Newspapers, Magazines and the like via Gemini, with Newswaffle. It's not simply a dump of the html text content, but instead makes a best guess at readability, eliminating navigation, sidebars, headers, footers and other cruft. And reduces the page size and load, sometimes by 95%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/waffle.cgi"&gt;NewsWaffle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also operate Chilly Weather, a great Gemini-native weather 'app'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/chilly.cgi"&gt;Chilly Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they've developed Kennedy, a new Gemini search engine; a Minesweeper clone and a geography game, as well as have a useful gem-log and some hosting services of various other blogs and comics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the process of making NewsWaffle they developed Stargate, which is a full HTTP-to-Gemini proxy, so you can access http sites via your Gemini client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these tools mean for me is that I now can have the relaxing text-driven experience of my dreams, in the client of my choice, with the minimal design (or at least colors!) of my choosing. This almost luddite use of the web is how I envisioned it could be for years. It's not simply a re-invention of Lynx, w3m, links2....but really a whole cleaned up minimal 'smol' version of the wider web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently in the process of building my own toy web browser with Love2d and http/s requests and I'm finding reading their article on converting http-to-md and gmi to be quite helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acidus has a short post about how Gemini is a fertile space for hacking. I hope to do some of my own experiments too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023-02-21&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This article covers http and gemini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;http&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 2000, I used a variety of search engines: AskJeeves (later, Ask.com), HotBot, Lycos, Yahoo, and others whose names I can no longer recall. I vaguely remember using Archie on dial-up text browsing, but cannot remember much about it beyond that it was used for FTP searches, and later Veronica for searching Gopher sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Google regularly starting about 2000. It helped me the summer I was a fact checker for a weekly paper in Philadelphia. Over time I became more concerned with the surveillance aspects of Google products. When I learned about DuckDuckGo in 2010 or 2011 I started trying it out. For a few years, I jumped back and forth between search engines but by about 2013 or 2014 I started using DDG only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With DuckDuckGo I appreciate the bangs most of all. I can type a word then !w and instantly pull up the wikipedia page, or an old tech object and !e and instantly it searches directly on Ebay. There are countless other examples. As DuckDuckGo has grown, I'm still mostly happy with it, but it does have more of the downsides of a major browser: some searches result mostly in product results rather than articles or info that I'm looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don't see any ads on DuckDuckGo. I have a few extensions on Firefox, and I cannot remember 100% if it's uBlockOrigin (I think), but I don't have any ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my iPad I installed ViolonCello, an app that is text-mode only. Unfortunately, the app maker has disappeared or not updated the app, so I don't see it available for download from the App store anymore (yet another mark against Apple). And I've not found another app that works as well or quickly, so I'm continuing to use it for now but it could disappear at some point when Apple next demands developers sign in to update and sign their apps (and pay for the privilege), so it feels like I'm just marking time on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Desktop, for the past year or two I've been trying a few other search engines out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the regular DuckDuckGo, it's worth knowing about the Lite version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/"&gt;Lite DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lite DuckDuckGo is pretty minimally styled. Simple and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://frogfind.com"&gt;FrogFind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"The Search Engine for Vintage Computers." This search engine is actually powered by DuckDuckGo, but it filters its results through Readability or a similar filter, and stripping down the pages to simple HTML. What this means is that it's fast, doesn't need https, so it works on old computers and devices. It's also a good fit for a text online browser, as it strips out nav, sidebars, pictures, and the like. 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiby.me/"&gt;Wiby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wiby search engine claims to be 'building a web of pages as it was in the earlier days of the internet.' What this seems to translate to is that it doesn't operate a web crawler to index pages but instead the operator of wiby adds pages to visit, and users can submit pages as well. They've also open sourced their code so you can operate your own small search engine. In practice, this is a fun search client that does feel a bit like the late 90s search. You can find useful and fun and random sites pop up, loosely related to your topic. It features a 'surprise me' search that often delights me when I find interesting sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/"&gt;Marginalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a "D.I.Y. search engine" for non-commercial content, "hosted on a single PC in Sweden." On the home page it mentions that it's best at finding small, old and obscure sites on specific niche topics. Also has a 'random page' mode. Viktor also has extensively written about ongoing development work, among many other topics, and has a presence on Gemini as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecosia.org/"&gt;Ecosia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don't use this very often. It's powered by Bing. The main reason to use this is because they use their ad revenue to donate profits toward environmental causes (80% of their income). I made it the default search on my Chromium browser. Just an aside here: I learned from Grant Peterson of Rivendell bikes that if you own more than one bike, you should try to set each of them up pretty differently so they'll feel different when you ride them. Different handlebars, different saddles, pedals, etc. Most of the time I use Firefox, with DuckDuckGo. So the occasional times I open Chromium on my computer, the default search is Ecosia. Ecosia generates revenue when you click on ads. But I don't think I've ever clicked on one, so I guess that renders the point of using this search engine moot for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org"&gt;Internet Archive Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this all the time to find old websites and to backup sites. It's a great way to find older sites and materials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;gemini&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://geminispace.info"&gt;Geminispace.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works pretty well. It's my preferred search engine on Gemini. I use it to do topic-based searches or to find gemposts I remember reading a while ago but can't remember who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://medusae.space"&gt;Medusae.space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a search engine! This is a directory, and the only one on this list. But I remember back to the 90s when I used to start browsing the web by navigating through directories and sub-topics, and this still feels like a valid way to navigate the gemini-verse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://tlgs.one/"&gt;Totally Legit Gemini Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an "experimental" search engine. I don't use it as much, but occasionally. Seems like it works fairly well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-12-31&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: bike jargon glossary at end of this article&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up riding bikes, living at the edge of a city and beginning of the suburbs. I was lucky to grow up near extensive woods with lots of both urban riding as well as offrode forest riding in an urban area. In college I biked with friends who were more enamored with bikes, organizing rides and silly races (and a root beer keg). They really got me excited for mountain biking, and after college I continued to ride as my main form of transportation, mostly on a singlespeed mountain bike for a few years, but later on a stable of bikes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic I moved out to the suburbs for a few months and lived near a county park with extensive mountain biking trails. I didn't bring my mountain bike but my cyclocross bike. I have 36mm knobby tires on this bike, and it's set up singlespeed/fixed. After a lifetime of living in cities I really enjoyed going out on daily mountain bike rides, especially after I've been so envious of others who lived near trails in more rural and suburban areas. In my mind these people with ideal bike backyards always live in Colorado or North Carolina! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in NYC near a large urban park, one with woods and about a mile trail but it's technically not a permitted public mountain bike trail. The known public bike trails in New York can be counted on one hand. Clue: there aren't any in Brooklyn, the borough I live in. For a long time (a year?) I had been excited to head out to Cunningham Park in Queens to do some real mountain biking. I had watched a few youtube videos, and was excited to try it out, but I wasn't sure how 'good' the trails would be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't own any bike with front or rear suspension and never have. I am a 'fully rigid' kind of rider. This summer, after almost two decades of admiring Rivendell bikes I purchased my own Rivendell: a Clem Smith Jr. "L", size large. This is a very unusual frame: the longest production frame of any bike manufacturer, combo of hand lugged and TIG-welded, hand painted, a mixte "step through" frame, and I had it set up with thick knobby 29" wheels and a 1x9 gearing. It also has generator lighting, which I recently had my local bike shop install. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/clem.gif" alt='Rivendell Clem Smith Jr. "L" bike'&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Rivendell Clem Smith Jr. "L" bike&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal was not just an 'everything' bike but one which could be used for bikepacking, trails with some singletrack, and urban riding all in one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of riding has been described under similar names and concepts and communities online. You may think of it within the spectrum of 'hybrid' bikes. You might see it called ATB (all terrain bike), xbiking (a reddit group), and Rivendell itself uses terms like "hillibike" instead of 'mountain biking' and there are other terms out there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bikepacking is a term for (mostly) offroad extended bike tours. My bike isn't exactly one of the bikepacking-specific ones, since I don't think it makes sense to buy a $2000 bike just for camping on it a week or two each year, but it's one that can work pretty well for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/lirr.gif" alt="Attempting to fit a huge bike onto the Long Island Rail Road"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Attempting to fit a huge bike onto the Long Island Rail Road&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to Cunningham park required a long commute. I biked to the Long Island Railroad station in Brooklyn, found the elevator to take my bike down, paid for a ticket and rolled the bike on. My bike was slightly too big to perfecly tuck into the commuter rail train, but no matter, the conductor didn't mind. 35 minutes later we pulled into...Queen Village, which is 2 1/2 miles from the bike park, but the closest station. I had 20 minutes of first urban riding and then suburban riding. I stopped at a bagel shop and got a tuna on 'everything' bagel, with capers and onions and tomato, and a small coffee and cole slaw. This place was 'to go' only so I packed it up and biked to the trail and ate it at the trail head. At this point, it had been an hour and forty-five minutes since leaving my house. I saw a few solo riders come through. I read the 'rules' on the posted sign, studied the map and took a photo. The Cunningham trails feature a few easier loops, and some smaller intermediate and advanced trails. I started by trying the easier loops. There was a lot of mud, and only a few features, that were kind of optional since you could bike around them pretty easily on the simpler trails. It felt nice to be moving around on a bike outdoors in the winter. I had biked an unseasonably warm day to ride and didn't need to wear much of a coat or gloves. I didn't love that the forest area we were in was surrounded on all sides by heavy traffic and highways. I don't love riding in the woods with the sound of whooshing speeding cars and trucks all around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about 20 minutes to go around the main loop, and I started it again but immediately took the turn-off for the intermediate trail. Less mud, but more obstacles now, but pretty randomly placed. A trail is said to be 'flowy' if it has nice long flowing sections with only occasional features. This trail wasn't exactly flowy but it wasn't chock full of challenges either, and I only stopped to cross a section by foot or stumble up a muddy hill pushing my bike once or twice. On my second loop I saw a man on a 'one-wheel' and two young kids on small bikes. He was going the wrong direction on the trail and said his kids were not enjoying the trail and he was trying to get them out of there. I warned them of some upcoming mud banks. I was thinking maybe it's not a perfect fit trail for complete beginners, mostly because I think the uphill climbs, while not so bad, are not good for those who aren't very fit or used to climbing on a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had read online that if you cross over the highway nearby the second section of the park had more challenging trails. It was true the second section was a bit more of a challenge, though maybe not signifantly so, but I didn't try every trail there. Overall, I covered most of the park in about 45 minutes or an hour, and enjoyed what I tried, though it wasn't one of my favorite mountain biking spots. To leave, I had to bike back to a train to get home. I decided to skip the commuter rail, since I'd have to time it well to make sure I got there in time and didn't miss the occasional train. I headed to the closest subway, which was quite far away, about 20 minutes of street riding, a gradual uphill some of that time. Then it was an hour and 15 minute train ride home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got near home, I got off the train and decided to do the loop at my local urban park, that's about a mile or two and it's not an official mountain bike course, though I don't see many other folks (walkers or whatnot) using the trail either. While being simpler and having barely any features, it was a comforting ride and most of the time I'll probably just ride there as it's so much more convenient than getting to the other park. Still, I'm glad I tried it and I'll probably go a couple times a year just to try it occasionally and see if it feels any different in the summer months, though maybe I'll go further afield to New Jersey or upstate New York on the train to find more exciting trails and bikepacking when the springtime hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glossary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1X ("one by..."): Instead of the oldskool 2 or 3 front derailler gears you only have a single gear up front. So you only shift with one hand, have less gears to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bikepacking: Multi-day bike tour on trails off road where you bring your tent, food, sleeping bag, water. Bikepackers eschew the traditional 'panniers' of oldskool bike tourers because they can snag on things when riding through trees and bushes for example, and disperse weight in ways that don't work as well off-road. Instead, they hang bangs from the handlebars, seat, and top tube of the bike frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclocross: offroad racing on a kind of hybrid bike. Riders go over grass, through mud, up hills, though this isn't really considered 'mountain biking'. They don't jump over rocks and roots much. Parts of the course a rider may choose to run and hold their bike on their shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature: an obstacle on a bike trail. Examples include a 'rock garden' collection of rocks to go over, a jump, a fallen or placed log to jump over, a puddle to cross, a rounded 'berm'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid: a now somewhat out-of-favor term for bikes in between mountain bikes and road bikes that are meant for urban riding, though may be able to pass muster on some light trails. Before his company Rivendell was born, its founder Grant Peterson ran the US base of operations for Bridgestone bikes division and one of his revered urban bikes was the XO-1, oriented around this kind of hybrid urban riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lugs: If you have a steel mountain bike, the metal tubes that make up the double diamond frame of a bicycle need to be connected together somehow. It's cheaper to weld them on an assembly line. It's fancier (though not necessarily stronger) to use the oldskool lug method, where little metal hand-made wraps connect the tubes together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixte: "Girls bike" as it's called in the US. This is a lowered 'top tube' frame, which makes it ideal for those with shorter upper body to leg length. City bikeshare programs at least in the states mostly feature this kind of bike. They make it easier for a variety of people heights to adapt to a bike, but aside from this, it's a lot easier to mount your bike, especially if you have bags or racks on the front or back. Europeans ride very practical bikes and many ride this kind of bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MTB: Mountain Bike&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigid: A Mountain bike without front shock on the fork or suspension on the back seat-tube. Retro-grouches think/feel that steel mountain bikes (as opposed to lightweight alumnimum or titanium perhaps) flexes more and you don't need the front fork, or that those kinds of bikes are overkill and meant for racing, not 'a ride in the woods.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singlespeed: A bike without gears. Became popular among hipster urban riders in the early aughts after bike messengers (who had been using them for years) were viewed as the ultimate cool urban warriors. Fixed is a singlespeed without a freewheel. When you pedal, the bike moves. If you stop pedaling the bike may continue to move and the pedals will turn and push your feet around or slap you in the shin if you don't pedal along with or resist it to slow down. Advantages: Singlespeed bikes are lighter than geared bikes, simpler to maintain, and provide a good exercise. Disadvantages: you have to stand up to attempt to crank up a hill, and sometimes you may have to push your bike up a hill. They can be bad on your knees if you don't have perfect form or you don't use an external brake (some people don't).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-12-08&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college I played a lot of music. I was in the university orchestra a couple years, playing bassoon. I joined the improv music collective, which I played in for four years. I eventually even took electronic music history and production classes, opera (music history), ethnomusicology, and composition classes. I DJed on the college radio station as well, a program dedicated to experimental and electronic music. All this is to provide some background to attest that I'm supposedly not a totally complete idiot when it comes to music! Okay, with that said, onto my story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sophomore year at university I was working on a sound project. I had a homemade electroacoustic instrument that I wanted to record, playing over some 'tape' aka electronic music I made on my computer. For the homemade electronic instrument, think something like the PDQ Bach instrument called the Double-reed Slide Music Stand. I think I had my bassoon mouthpiece connected to my didgeridoo or maybe my actual music stand neck, with a DIY contact mic pickup. And I had some experimental backing textures I had made on my laptop, from downloaded and homemade audio samples. Aside from this, I had a tape machine and my stereo system I had purchased used at the thrift store, an old beautiful wood Marantz receiver. And I needed to record audio from both my electronic slide music stand bassoon and my computer output simultaneously. Playing both the computer audio via my external speakers, and the crumhorn-pipe-bassoon into a small speaker at once I could record them simultaneously from the mini microphone input on my tape machine but the audio quality would be horrible. In 2022 I would probably just do it and consider the added texture part of the intended ambience. But in 2001 that kind of lo-fidelity sound was not necessarily my intention. My roommate, bandmate and all-around fellow nerd Doug was in class. So I was on my own to figure this out. I thought for a little bit but then quickly had an idea and I gathered my needed supplies. Soon I was humming along. The DIY contact mic on my slide-stand-bassoon was plugged into the left side input of the Marantz stereo receiver. With my laptop I plugged a stereo cable, converted to a RCA, only connecting one side to the right side of stereo receiver input. With this crappy dual low-volume input I pumped up the gain significantly on the stereo, using its warm analog amplifier capabilities. The stereo output, with the two instruments mixed to separate left and right channels, was atrociously combined through connecting them to my mono input cassette recorder option. So while I didn't have a stereo recording, I did at least have two channels of audio with both instrumens in them and was able to record my musical masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/music-stand.gif" alt="double slide reed music stand"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;double slide reed music stand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Doug came home several hours later I was elated to show him my creation, with its combination of a gang of cables and converters and using all of the electronic instruments and players I had at hand. He immediately looked at it, dubiously, started laughing and said "Congratulations, you've invented the mixer." The strange thing was: he was right. For the entire time I had worked with this setup (maybe an hour or two) I had forgotten that an audio "mixer" was indeed a thing, probably because I hadn't actually used one before. All I knew was that I needed to combine audio wet-on-wet on top of each other, and I figured out a solution with what I had on hand to make it so. It wasn't until the following years I took experimental electronic audio production classes taught by an oldksool electronic music composer (from the 70s! we had an old Buchla 100 in the music lab). While Doug thought what I had done was trivial and silly, I was proud of myself for my ingenuity, even if I wouldn't really use that system again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that time I've continued to make music, art, and other creative output, sometimes with my DIY make-it-work hat on, and other times using my university training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I'm a programmer as well. With the abundance of open source software out there, and with the rise of mega software repositories like NPM and GitHub it might sound crazy to reinvent the wheel. But at least in the online circle of artist-hackers I'm in, this kind of behavior in encouraged: learning, puzzle-solving, using minimal resources, and building what you need. In fact, you may do this as well. On Gemini, everyone and their grandmother has made a Gemini server or client. I've even cobbled my own toy client together based on ncap and thought about extending it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some other wheels I've reinvented?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calendar: Right now I'm in the process of dogfooding my own calendar software that I've been using a half year so far. I use it fulltime everyday for both my calendar software and TODO lists, but it's mostly controlled with the CLI, has demo web views, and still has over a dozen features I need to implement. I started building it because I was so reliant on using the CLI software gcalcli, which implements Google calendar in the command line but controls one's web calendar. Gcalcli had some unfixable annoying deployment bug when Google changed some API (as far as I remember), and I really had wanted to get off Google completely all along. When looking for an alternative I didn't take to the ones I found like NextCloud's calendar or the Calcurse CLI program and I thought I could build something better! Or at least crappier and to my own needs. Timetable is working well for me so far, and when it gets to a level that others may be able to use it too, I'll be sure to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read-Later Software: For years I used Pocket, but I was unhappy with it. I didn't like its suggestions, had some problems with having to sign in all the time on different devices, and some other annoyances. I considered Wallabag but it didn't look like the solution for me. Sure, maybe I could have built a wrapper around one of these, but instead I built my own. A CLI program that easily downloads a website or article, routes it through the Mozilla Reabability view and converts to an output form like epub, markdown, etc. I've made a number of add-on software like a suite, including using it to download entire reams of articles saved on the Internet Archive's wayback machine, then converting them to readability view and saving them on my machine as an internal library. Hey, maybe I should combine this with my toy gemini client to make my own alternative browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diary: I keep a daily log using my own simple diary software that I wrote. Again, CLI only (notice a theme here?), easily written and saved and added to a private file on my laptop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backup: This program performs a weekly service to copy the contents of any new files to an external drive. It's largely using rsync with some additional juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scratchpad: There are so many drawing programs available. Why make yet another one? I wanted one that would launch instantly from (Neo)vim and save inline in my wiki, yet also work on the web. So I wrote it using p5.js to access the JavaScript canvas API and a Vim Language launch command and key binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemtext -&amp;gt; Http converter and blog updater: The gemtext converter I finished a long time ago and use regularly. Currently I'm working on updating some add-on software that would automatically update my external http blog mirror as well (which you may be reading this text on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOGO: This language is decades old, somewhat out of date and out of fashion. And I wrote my own implementation using Javascript and the p5.js library, just for fun! To see if I could, and to see what I would learn. And to make art using it. It was fun. I don't use it much anymore, but it was a good learning experience and I'd probably try it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, these 'new wheels' are more like the Unix philosophy of litte tools we already know. I am writing in shell or Lua or JavaScript, using system programs, and perhaps one or two additional programs like pandoc for some added functionality. Maybe most of what we are doing, like artists working in the studio, is constantly telling ourselves we are reinventing the wheel while we stumble upon new solutions and use knowledge and tools gleaned elsewhere as well. Sometimes ignorance is best: letting us test ourselves and build what we need, possibly with a minimum of resources and a lot of gumption. I don't regret the hours of my life I've spent reinventing the wheel. I think it makes for a pretty enjoyable time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-12-02&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="void.html"&gt;Choosing Void Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="installing-void.html"&gt;Notes on installing Void Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've now been using Void for a bit over a month. I really enjoy it and want to convert my last Ubuntu computer to Void. I'm going to wait another few weeks, just to confirm stability, and then make the full switch, but mostly I think it'll just be fine. But Void isn't a simple works-out-of-the-box install, so this is a document of my own work in order to be able to reproduce it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are my notes and a collection of useful snippets. To be honest, I don't feel confident this is a 'final' level of configuration. Maybe a first step. For example, I didn't try to set up a printer, bluetooth, and the like, and I want to try some machine learning work to later on with the machine. At the end of this post I'll link to some info on others' more extensive post-install scripts and guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I like Void because it's fast, minimal, and gets out of your way. If I need more functionality or programs, I can install it within seconds usually. I've found almost all my usual packages are available via Void's main and non-free repositories. For the occasional program that's not, I've been able to install dependencies and install and compile downloaded programs to run, or just run the provided binary, or use xdeb to repackage debian packages for void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, I've had the occasional bug pop up. Occasionally, I'll turn on my computer and the wifi isn't working. Has happened maybe 3 times. In those cases I had to restart and things then worked fine. No idea why. Currently, setting up the clock to sync correctly must be done manually. Setting up audio must be done manually. That seems bizarre to me and everyone else I've seen review Void, except for the Void maintainers who always push back saying that they need to maintain a balance between minimalism and bloated or preconfigured software. Fair enough, I hear that, I just can't understand the lack of fully working sound or clock. Having said that, this point was made in a friendly manner, as a difference of opinion. I think these two things just working would make this a friendlier distro to those trying it out, but in the scheme of things I figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, anytime I've had a bug I couldn't quite solve I found that posting to the voidlinux subreddit would quickly get responses from the community or the Void developer team. I'm not a reddit user other than this, so was annoyed I had to sign up but in general in every case the community has been able to quickly help me solve the problem and I've found they are mostly very friendly and responsive. They want to encourage more people to find success with the distro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;vpm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this in a previous post. Through a combo of laziness, simplification and 'who cares' I've decided not to memorize the random-seeming xbps programs and flags and instead just use the intuitive vpm program which is a wrapper around xbps package manager programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo xbps-install -S vpm
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereafter installing something is as simple as &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo vpm install package
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I'll run autoremove to clean out old package dependencies off my hard drive from packages I may have removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo vpm autoremove
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the commands below, feel free to modify vpm to xbps-install if you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Installing a gui file viewer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void does not come with default file manager beyond the command line. Many folks recommend and use Thunar but I like the Gnome file manager/viewer much better than thunar. It's styled simpler, less visual clutter. Its old name was Nautilus and they're in the process of renaming it to just "Files" I believe, but the install name is nautilus. If you use dmenu to launch programs, you'll launch it with the word nautilus. If you use ulancher (which is the launcher i've installed), then it can be found via typing Files in the ulauncher search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo vpm install nautilus
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have previous experience or want to try thunar, you can install that. For CLI file managers I use nnn, fff and lf occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Installing a Volume mixer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many folks have complained about how audio is not setup automatically in Void. I agree, it's a little annoying. I explained in a previous post how I got audio working on Void. With the below command I can add audio to the system tray, but there still isn't a volume mixer in the status bar. Instead it just opens up pulse audio and I can manually set the volume in the settings. Setting alsa in the runit services does a minor thing: maintains volume level across system restarts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo vpm install pavucontrol xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/alsa /var/service
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reboot after. Note if you are using alsa without pulseaudio then you need to install alsa-utils and volumeicon instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch from dmenu with pavucontrol or in ulauncher it's called Pulse Audio Volume Controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/yf2vn3/audio_problemnoob_question/"&gt;Audio problems for noobs (Reddit)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to sync time on Void.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a weird one. To be honest, I don't understand why the clock isn't set to 'just work' on Void correctly, though potentially this is a recent issue for Void as I don't see many questions about it in the past. Basically, randomly I would turn on my computer and the clock wasn't correct, either off by several hours, or an hour ahead, so I needed to sync the clock manually. The hardware clock varies by computer but is usually set as UTC. In software you need to specify your timezone, which is an offset from this hardware clock. You can do this with a symlink or by manually setting the TIMEZONE="America/New_York" or your locale in the rc.conf. But then you also need to use NTP to set proper time. I read that NTP is buggy and there were alternatives, so following a brief tutorial on Reddit I installed chrony and ended up using that. At least so far, this has worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo vpm install chrony
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/chronyd /var/service
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/z691x6/tutorial_how_to_sync_the_time_on_void_linux/"&gt;Tutorial: How to sync the time on Void Linux (Reddit)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Alternative to dmenu for launching programs: ulauncher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using i3 window manager which includes dmenu application launcher in its default. Dmenu is minimal and can be configured by adding patches and recompiling. I didn't want to mess with that. I prefer 'good defaults' in lots of my software, which is why I use fish shell instead of Bash for example. After using Regolith Linux, an i3-based distribution on Ubuntu with gorgeous defaults, I was spoiled by the beautiful app launcher ilia, which itself is inspired by rofi. I tried rofi. I thought it was okay but didn't want to configure it. I then came across ulauncher. I found it worked really well with great defaults out of the box. I type Ctrl-Space and ulauncher opens and I start typing the name of a program and it opens. I still have dmenu installed simultaneously (Mod+D) but I haven't been using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo vpm install ulauncher
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing ulauncher I had to add it to my i3 config to start on boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# ~/.config/i3/config
exec --no-startup-id ulauncher
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a minor bug that after login the ulauncher prompt opens and I have to hit escape. I couldn't figure out a way to get it to launch in the background and close on i3, but I gave up as 'it's good enough.' This is an i3-related issue I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few i3 window manager tweaks I like to add to my i3 config file, but that isn't specific to Void, so I won't post about that here. The key things I set in i3 are setting a workspace background image, setting Dvorak keyboard, remapping Caps Lock to Escape, having volume up and volume down buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Working with Debian deb packages on Void&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything is available in the Void repos. You can install another package manager and library like flatpak or nix. You can also build packages from source. Or you can use xbps-src. Here's yet one more option: xdeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xdeb is a "simple utility to convert deb(ian) packages to xbps packages." I wanted to, for example, download and run rogue, the original roguelike. But I couldn't seem to find all the dependencies, and get them to work in the right combination. So I was frustrated. Using xdeb it was a matter of a minute to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Void's maintainers don't want to add it to the nonfree packages repo but thankfully there are straightforward fast ways to install xdeb on your system explained on its github page. I'll link to it below, as it gives a few options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/toluschr/xdeb"&gt;Download xdeb &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted xdeb to be able to run everywhere, so I moved it to /usr/local/bin so it would be available everywhere. After I used xdeb to package rogue I then moved rogue to my /usr/games folder so that would be available everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Links to others' post-install setups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I think my post-install tweaks may just be a first step. There are many other Void Linux post-install suggestions and scripts online. Below I'll link to a  couple that I think are worth perusing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/bastomiadi/abf27618341fc561735adfb17e586916"&gt;bastomiadi's post-installation notes (github gist)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/CTZxVULKAN/dots/wiki/3.-Void-Linux-Post-Install"&gt;CTZxVULKAN's post-installation notes (github)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other Void tips or tutorials you recommend checking out, I'd be open to hearing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-11-08&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently one of my students came up to me and talked to me about the difficulty she is having accessing a computer with Processing, which we use in the class I'm teaching. She doesn't have her own computer and she told me she didn't qualify for a school loaner laptop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I found a cheap or free laptop that could be a potential solution. I told her I would look for a laptop and try to locate one within a week. I have a few old Raspberry Pi's around, but that wasn't the right fit. I asked friends for suggestions, and I received a suggestion to look in local thrift stores for old Chromebooks. Unfortunately, that's not really a viable option in NYC. There are few thrift stores around, and those that do generally do not sell electronics, much less old Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Craigslist is thriving here, and I saw a variety of cheap Chromebooks for sale. Would they be powerful enough to run Processing? I looked online. It looked like it was very possible if I could boot into a Debian-based distro, but it was not definitive. There were some listed options for using a chroot to run Ubuntu, but it appeared slow and everything was years old. I wasn't sure the current state. I also saw a variety of difficult options for installing Ubuntu (or another *buntu on top of ChromeOS). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How hard could it be? I was particularly interested in showing my student how easy it is to install Linux and how easy it is to use. Ideally it should only take 20 minutes to make a USB drive iso and then boot from that drive and install a light Ubuntu variant, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little searching I wasn't filled with confidence as it was immediately clear you can't just flash an ISO to a USB, launch an installer and call it a day. No. For this reason, I decided to install it myself in case I got stuck for hours or days in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my convoluted process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Acquire laptop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write an email at 11pm to an ad on Craigslist listing a Chromebook for $50. The person responds several minutes later. We agree to meet Monday at 9am at the main train station next to the clock tower. Things are looking up. Monday morning rolls around. He's running a few minutes late but that's okay. I find him and he tells me the battery is dead but he just erased the computer. I make a split second judgement to trust him. I have 3 twenties. I could go buy a coffee I guess though I don't really drink coffee. No matter, he takes $40. Great! In a second he's gone. I jump on a subway to go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things that need to happen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read 30+ websites and fora trying to come up with a plan. It looks like years ago it was pretty easy to flash Ubuntu and there were many options. Now Google has really locked down the computer. The main approach is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn on insecure legacy boot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Update firmware&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other stuff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profit?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start up the Chromebook and connect to WIFI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Samsung Chromebook 3 which comes withe Braswell firmware. When I looked it up, I read it must be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Failure to turn off write protection &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to open the back of the computer up to remove a hidden screw in a complicated position that could majorly mess things up if I screw up. The screw is responsible for ensuring Write Protection of the firmware. But I need to turn this off if I want to install a new firmware and new OS on top of the old, or so I believe. I have one mini screwdriver but I need two different sizes and so I can't take the back off. Am I dead in the water?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://maxwyb.github.io/linux/2016/11/05/chromebook-write-protection.html"&gt;Screws on the back of the Chromebook 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rack my brain and decide I will try to run Linux off an external drive and see if that's viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Turn off secureboot So we can boot off a USB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Enable developer mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Turn off verified boot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Enable dev usb boot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Boot into recovery mode&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Escape + Refresh key (3 buttons to the right of escape) + Power button. Let go of power and it'll start up in Recovery Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it starts up it tells me to insert a USB. Nah, not yet. Press Ctrl-D to turn off verified boot. Wait 10 seconds and when prompted I press enter. It'll reboot and asks me to hit enter again to confirm. I make sure it says OS Verification is OFF. Press Ctrl-D again. It begins reflashing my drive and booting into developer mode. It takes about 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enable Dev usb boot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually it starts back up and I see the traditional welcome screen on ChromeOS. I skipped signing in and clicked Sign in as Guest in the bottom left so I don't need to make a Google account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally get into the desktop environment I open the Terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I type shell and enter to get a Linux command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switch to bash with root privileges to make changes to booting by typing sudo bash and hitting enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the typical warning about sudo 'with great power comes great responsibility' mumbo jumbo. I type enable_dev_usb_boot and enter. A success message appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set up dev boot legacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I open the terminal with Ctrl-Alt-F2 (right arrow). I login to 'chronos'. No password. I type sudo crossystem dev_boot_legacy=1 and then my prompt. First weird thing occurs. The prompt tells me instead to try dev_boot_altfw instead. Hmm. I run sudo crossystem dev_boot_altfw=1 and get no error so maybe this is alternative firmware and it worked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Update firmware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm on a Samsung Chromebook 3 which runs Intel Braswell, so I saw it needed its firmware updated. I ran the update firmware automation script from mrchromebook.tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
cd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh
sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 firmware-util.sh
sudo firmware-util.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings up a menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to select 2 Install/Update UEFI Firmware but I couldn't because WriteProtect was enabled since I wasn't able to take off the back of the machine to remove a screw. But I could do 1) and update the current Legacy BIOS firmware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make a flash drive iso&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded a GalliumOS iso even though it's not maintained anymore. I had been thinking I'd download Lubuntu but against my better judgement I decided to try Gallium since it was built specifically for Chromebook. I used Balena Etcher to write the iso to USB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://galliumos.org/"&gt;GalliumOS (not maintained)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Start up with your USB drive loaded with linux&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once written to disk, I plugged in the USB drive to the Chromebook and start up in recovery mode by pressing Escape + Refresh + Power to start up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Ctrl-U to start from the USB. Or was it Ctrl-L?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts up and I run the installer, which is self-explanatory like picking keyboard, city and the like. It takes just a few minutes. I shut down and remove the USB installer. Fingers crossed....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/chromebook.gif" alt="Chromebook booting GalliumOS, displaying Processing, dithered image "&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Chromebook booting GalliumOS, displaying Processing, dithered image &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works! Even despite not turning off WriteProtect? Hmm. Not sure. But I'll go with it since it's working.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Each time the computer is turned on we need to run Ctrl-L to escape the regular startup process and boot into Gallium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it's started, I have a really nice looking desktop and the machine (despite being pretty low power) is fast! I opened up the terminal and sudo apt updated and sudo apt upgraded. Then I tried out the package manager App Grid Software Center and installed LibreOffice, Solitaire, Tetris and some other software for my student. There was already a variety of basic apps for playing music, displaying images, file manager, etc. I visited the Processing website and downloaded the latest version, 4.0.1 and downloaded it. I used tar to uncompress and then ran the bash installer file. This installed Processing to the desktop and placed its icon in the launcher menu under Development. I wrote a basic Processing Hello World program, tested it ran, and saved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I downloaded a picture of my college and set it as the desktop background. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to introduce this machine to my student. And to see what she does with it. I hope it will be useful for her classes, browsing the web, doing homework and practicing coding in Processing. If I get any feedback from her, I'll report back further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-11-04&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big welcome to folks that are just joining Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been on Mastodon about 2 years I think and I really love it. Although I have a twitter account I may have only logged in 5 times in the past year or so, and that's just to check my messages, which I could have set to automatically send to my email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I love Mastodon? There's no ads. There's no celebrities. There's no constant news churn. There's no 'algorithm,' just a chronological list of toots. I also really like that I've found all these little communities of interest based on topics. I can have real conversations and meet folks from around the world with my interests. On Twitter it used to feel like this occasionally but more often it felt like people constantly 'reacting'. People don't tend to do that on Mastodon, at least in my friend group. It's more like they give update on their life and projects, ask questions, get feedback. It's like a non-shitty slack or twitter. I also like I can use my choice of clients, from graphical to web to command line (try tut or toot tui ). I can turn off 'retoots' so that means I only see when people post their own content, not others. While it's still addictive social media, I can run out of content to see, and that's a good thing, so I'm not checking it constantly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple recommendations for folks new to Mastodon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Fill out your profile and add a photo/image asap! Include links to another home of yours on the internet, such as your music, website, etc. Many folks don't like to be followed by anonymous accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Create a post introducing yourself and maybe add the #introduction tag, and then pin it to the top of your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. When you post media like photos or videos, add an alt text description. This is done in your mastodon client software or website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. If you joined one of the smaller server of peers, great! Click on "Local" to see what folks from your server are posting. It's a good way to "meet" lots of folks right away and get a feel for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. More so than on birdsite, folks here tend to like to give Content Warnings (also known as "CW") for certain topics. You'll see examples of this modeled and learn how to do it. It's a great idea to follow this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Support your server(s) financially if you can. Hosting infrastructure does cost money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'm leaving out other important stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-11-04&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apply to a number of grants, Call for Artists, Requests for Proposals, proposals for conference talks, and more. I usually apply to about half a dozen or so a month, though sometimes many more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was first applying to things a few years ago I met with a friend who showed me how she did it. She used a google spreadsheet. I copied some parts of her system and then built my own system that I've been using for years now. It's simple and works for me. Feel free to use any of this info, which is pretty basic, in case it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is completely on my organizational system and not at all on the content of what I choose to write/apply with. I may do a post on that at some point, but it's not found here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Organization system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A single Opportunities.md file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a single plaintext (markdown) file that lists Upcoming deadlines, followed by a section called Applied, followed by a section called Missed. If I apply to something, I move the line from Upcoming to Applied. If I missed one I move it to Missed. I don't look at Missed very often at all if ever. I check Applied after I get email responses to things letting me know whether I got a grant or not. For example, I sometimes apply to 100 things a year and might not hear back from an application for months or up to a year, so it helps me to go back and see "what was that again?" This is a very simple system because I need it simple and foolproof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that below I'm leaving out the info on the individual things I'm applying to. After, I'll show you what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
# Opportunities.md

## Upcoming Deadlines
* xxxx
* xxxx
* etc ..

## Applied
* xxxx
* xxxx

## Missed
* xxxx
* xxxx
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above I showed you the basic organization of my document. Here's what a single application line will look like for me, in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
* [ ] Name of organization and/or grant/funding/conference - [more info](https://link-to-info.com) - Deadline date, time, timezone - quick note on what I'm thinking I will propose
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those on a device that makes it hard to scroll, I'll break it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
* [ ] - text here
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a list item with a checkbox when converted to markdown in some specs. I click the checkbox by filling it with a X instead of a space when complete. I then move it down to the "Applied" section in my text file. For those things I don't end up applying for because I didn't have a good idea or I missed it, I move the line to the "Missed" section. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the checkbox I list the organization and conference name, then a link to where the info and application is located online, followed by the deadline day, time, timezone. Sometimes I add a quick few words on what I think I may apply with, which could be a specific project I have in mind. Other times I don't know and leave this blank for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I'll describe how I organize the "work" of applying to each opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A series of folders with my apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is where I do the writing and saving of my files relating to these applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

Opportunities&amp;gt;
            Year&amp;gt;
	         Opportunity-Name&amp;gt;
		         individual-file1.txt
		         individual-file2.jpg
			 ..etc..
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a directory called Opportunities. In that I have directories for each year. Inside each year directory I have a separate directory for each opportunity I end up applying to. Usually I copy files from a previous application I've done and duplicate it into this new opportunity's folder. Then I open it up and end up editing this application to more appropriately respond to the call. Often these opprtunities I'm applying for use a Google form or similar. So I copy the questions (followed by listing the character/word count) to a text file, then I write and edit in the text file. This is helpful because I can check my word count or character count and keep editing til I get it right. I also don't have to worry about what happens if the website crashes and I've been doing my editing inside the form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For artist calls I usually have to submit a portfolio of images, or links to a portfolio somewhere on the internet. For academic conferences I usually have to submit a CV, either my full professional CV or else a 1 page CV, or sometimes a 3 page CV. Other times they ask for a bio, an artist statement, or something else. Always I start by using previous text I've written, then modifying it for character count, or to tailor its content to that specific call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a little more detail on how the directories are organized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Opportunities &amp;gt;
              2022 &amp;gt;
	           Electronic-People-conf&amp;gt;
		                        app.txt
		                        one-page-CV.pdf
		   Smalltown-Public-Art-Call&amp;gt;
		                        app.txt
					full-CV.odf
					portfolio&amp;gt;
					   list_of_files.txt
					   lastname_firstname_01.jpg
					   lastname_firstname_02.jpg
					   lastname_firstname_03.jpg
	 	   Some-exhibit-open-call&amp;gt;
		                        app.txt
					CV
	      2021 &amp;gt;
	      2020 &amp;gt;
	      ..etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deadlines and Timezones!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live on the east coast of the US, and many of the things I'm applying to have deadlines of midnight on the last day of a month at midnight EST. For example, I had several grants due on midnight on halloween this week. Other grants are due at midnight on the 1st of the month. Organizations or conferences on the west coast of the US have deadlines perhaps at midnight PST, which is 3am here. Organizations or universities in Europe could be one of several different times. Some organizations, particularly government institutional ones specify deadlines of 5pm in their timezone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you apply to everything way in advance, you can ignore this. Unfortunately, that's not me. I'm sometimes working on an app on the last day and hours it's due. For this reason I always have to be careful I check the timezone, then translate that to my timezone so I know exactly when an app deadline is dropdead due. Unfortunately, with daylight savings and similar phenomenon this causes confusion, especially as the US may or may not switch following Daylight savings, some states ignore it, some parts of Europe follow a different daylight savings switch date, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this many particularly European opportunities list UTC time. But...my favorite timezone is Anywhere on Earth (AoE)! I've only ever seen this specified on one opportunity I've applied for, G-d bless it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anywhere on Earth (AoE) is a calendar designation which indicates that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth. It is a practice to help specify easy to understand deadlines such as "March 16, 2004, End of Day, Anywhere on Earth (AoE)" without requiring timezone calculations or Daylight saving time adjustments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's my organization system. Hopefully it's useful for you. Best of luck on your projects!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-10-28&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 on selecting, installing and running Void Linux. This is definitely only reading for a particular niche audience. You have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 contains info on my own entry and background in Linux and how I ended up getting to Void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./void.html"&gt;Choosing Void Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I'll go through my install of Void on physical hardware. There are a number of other Void Linux install tutorials on YouTube and as articles. I linked to the one I found most useful below. I add my own notes here not to duplicate others' efforts but to document my own particular niche install needs since this info is not available in a single place elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bare minimum goals for this Void installation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dvorak keyboard, no qwerty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;simplest hard drive partitioning possible since this is new for me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;i3 window manager (plus dmenu, which comes with it)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;fish shell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Documentation I referenced&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/live-images/guide.html"&gt;Void Linux official install guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/void/quickinst.htm"&gt;Quick and Reliable Void Linux Installation &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;High level install process explained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the main idea when installing Void Linux: You download an iso file. You have several official (and unofficial) options that come packaged with or without a window manager. You download this to a disk, real or virtual, then start up the machine running it instead of your previous OS. This launches you into the most minimalist of minimal systems, running Void Linux off that disk. Then you run void-installer in the command line as root to walk through the steps to write your new Void system onto your hard drive, virtual or physical depending on whether you're doing this in virtual machine or on actual physical hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install system is a text user interface program that has you run through various basic tasks. There are a few bugs of note unfortunately in this process. In any case, you choose your language (which takes no effect, a bug!), timezone, etc and then choose how to partition your hard drive, and where to mount the file system (sounds harder than it is). If all goes well, you 'burn' this to disk, reboot your computer, pull out the USB (or DVD) install disk, and cross your fingers until your new Void system boots up. When it boots up you have an extremely minimal environment and you need to configure it by updating the system, choosing your preferred keyboard, downloading needed software, terminal, fonts, shell, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the main overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The tricky bits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing one of these 'minimal' installs has a few parts that felt intimidating to me previously, which is why I had never tried it before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;did I have BIOS or UEFI?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of partitioning questions: how do I partition the drive? and how many gigabytes and what kind of partitions do I need? This was all pre-chosen for me when installing Ubuntu previously or even debian on a raspbprry pi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;will I be able to get sound to work? (lots of people point out that it does not come preconfigured)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this is just to say: I figured this stuff out. It's not too bad. I made some mistakes. But nothing was permanently messed up. And I learned a lot and know how to do this now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The actual steps to install&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted i3 window manager and glibc (the mainstream C library, so more software is immediately available). The Void maintainers have many different varieties of Void packaged for download, but not one with i3. I decided to download an unofficial build of Void linux with i3 instead of doing a base minimal install and adding i3 myself afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://voidbuilds.xyz"&gt;Void Builds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading the voidlinux iso with i3 and glibc I unzipped it. I used balena-etcher software to select the iso I downloaded and write it to a USB. While that was running I started up the computer I was going to install Void on. I pressed F2 (differs on various computers) and selected BIOS setup. I made sure legacy boot was on instead of UEFI. I turned secureboot off. There are many other options available but these were the things I needed to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I took the USB with the Void iso written to it. I plugged it into my computer waiting to receive it. I rebooted and pressed F12 (differs by computer) and selected to boot from the USB, using 'legacy' BIOS not UEFI. Within a few seconds Void's logo flashes and Void starts up, running off the usb. Since I chose an i3 version the i3 setup wizard appears. I press down to select Alt as my mod key. There's nothing to see after this. In i3 we launch the terminal with Alt + Enter. I'm a dvorak keyboard user and don't have any keyboard setup qwerty and can't touch-type qwerty, so I needed to switch from the default qwerty. In the terminal I typed: ```setxkbmap dvorak```. This will temporarily switch to Dvorak for this session only. With that out of the way it's time to run the installer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void's installer is a Curses-based (text) TUI program. You go step by step down a menu of text dialog boxes, making choices. I won't go through all of these in detail because I think the choices are relatively obvious. For example, first you pick your keyboard, then you pick your timezone/locale, your country, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more excruciatingly detailed step by step directions use the Void handbook or the tutorial I linked to above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type void-installer to launch it. The first setting is keyboard. I opened it and chose ANSI-Dvorak but as previously mentioned it takes no effect whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep running down the installer, doing each step top to bottom. The second menu item is the network. It will launch a terminal program to test your network. If you're plugged into ethernet it will confirm the network is configured properly. If you need wifi, oh no, let's set it up. Like above, we need to switch to a Terminal and configure wifi. Mod + Enter launches another terminal, type ```nmcli dev wifi connect "your network name" password "your wifi password"```. Then it should confirm, or else try again. Exit that terminal by typing exit or quitting with Ctrl-Shift-Q (in i3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go back to the installer menu. Confirm your network internet is working. After selecting locale and timezone, you also choose source. I did local disk install. I created a root password, then a new user and password for my username. When it asks me to pick a group membership I hit enter to accept the defaults (such as wheel, audio, etc). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas I had the most questions around were the bootloader and how to partition my computer. For bootloader, select the hard drive you're installing to (hint: it's not the USB drive that's stuck in). You can say yes to wanting a graphic terminal for GRUB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get to partitioning. This messed me up before I understood what I was doing. Now that I understand it, it's not bad at all. But this part is confusing in the installer as the installer shows old partition stats if you had a partitioned disk previously not a new hard drive. So instead of using it (since it shows the old info), I actually switch to a different workspace again and launch another terminal. Launch ```cfdisk -z``` to open the cfdisk program with no assumed previous partitioning. For BIOS, choose dos. We'll make two partitions. Step by step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Make a new partition. This will be my "swap." For this first partition I typed in a size of 18G (aka 8GB) since my alienware has 12GB ram and the recommended amount from the Void installer tutorial for this size is 1.5 times the amount of RAM you have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then I selected to make this primary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. I changed its type to Linux Swap (82 in the list). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Press down and choose new partition again for the second (and final partition). I allowed it to use all remaining GB of the drive, the default for its size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. I chose to make this partition primary as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Change its type to Linux (83). Now highlight this second partition (press down if you need to, to get to /dev/sda2, and select to make it bootable. A little star * appears in the bootable column. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Finally, select write to write this to disk and then select to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Now we switch back to the installer. If you were in another workspace you can choose Mod + 1 to move back. In the installer select filesystems. Highlight /dev/sda1 our swap, select SWAP, press OK and enter to format it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Then move down and highlight /dev/sda2 our main drive and select ext4 for its type and OK and press enter. Tell the program to mount it at / (the root). Confirm "yes" you want to write. Navigate to "back" to exit this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Choose install and wait a few minutes. This took less than 3 minutes on my system but it could take perhaps up to 10 minutes depending on the speed of your hardware. When done choose **back** to exit and then in a terminal type ```poweroff```.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. Yank out the USB. Cross your fingers. Turn the computer back on and hopefully your new Void system turns on. You'll be greeted by the login screen (which is in qwerty again, oy vay, last time). Type your password in qwerty just this one time and hit enter. You'll be greeted by the i3 config wizard again so press down to select alt key for mod if that's your choice. And now you're in your new void system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Immediately after install&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After install I launched my new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last time launch the terminal with mod+return and run the following command to switch to Dvorak for this session. We'll make it permanent in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;shell
setxkbmap dvorak
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let's make it permanent. When I was confused why setting ANSI-Dvorak hadn't changed anything, I posted a question about it on the Voidlinux reddit and got some immediate anwers. One person told me to create a file dvorak.conf and put it inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ I had to create the directory first and then I launched vim and saved this file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Section "InputClass"
Identifier "Keyboard"
Option "XxbLayout" "us"
Option "XkbModel" "pc105"
Option "XkbVariant" "dvorak"
EndSection
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I updated the system packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo xbps-install -Su
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran this twice to make sure I had updated xbps-install and then all the packages I had in the base unoffical i3 install system (which I believe are built nightly). To be safe, you can run this command a few times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I added the non-free repos so I have access to that software as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo xbps-install void-repo-nonfree void-repo-multilib-nonfree
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, xbps is the package manager on Void. It's a series of multiple programs for install, querying, removing, etc, each with their own minor differences. I wanted a single easier-to-type command since I kept mistyping xbps and then having to look up update, install, search flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo xbps-install vpm
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed an alternative wrapper around the package manager that simplifies commands for noobs. It's called vpm, seemingly standing for 'void package manager'. Like everything else on Void, it takes a split second to install. It's really noticeable how much faster Void is than Debian's apt repositories and package manager for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vpm commands are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
vpm update
vpm install package-name
vpm remove package-name
vpm search package-name
vpm list
vpm cleanup
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more commands than this but these are what I use most of the time. vpm will always show you the underlying xbps alias command that it's running and then the output. So it's possible I may commit the original xbps commands to memory and switch back at some point from using vpm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You prepend vpm commands with sudo. Or switch for this session with ```sudo su```. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some of the starter programs I installed, keeping in mind that alsa, git and a bunch of other programs were pre-installed in my unofficial build. This is in alphabetical order. You may need to scroll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
vpm install terminology busybox cool-retro-term cowsay ffmpeg fff feh fish-shell firefox gnome-screenshot lua luarocks mplayer neofetch neovim nnn pyradio sox vlc w3m w3m-img tldr pandoc
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I'm not mistaken, qutebrowser came pre-installed, along with git, python, qt, and many other useful programs. If you don't want anything preinstalled, use a minimal install iso. I'm already noticing some advantages over my Ubuntu install with fff, nnn, and pyradio being available since I had to build them from source on Ubuntu, and firefox was a simple install away versus Ubuntu that forces it packaged as a snap build even though you download from the apt repository, requiring a hack workaround to prevent the crappy snap build from re-installing. An aside: the snap build of Firefox is slow to launch (over 10 seconds), and when saving from snap it defaults to a generic downloads folder and has to be reset every time, requiring a number of mouse clicks. Decisions like this from the Ubuntu team are yet another reason why I appreciate the sane minimal consistent defaults made by the Void dev team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step after initial setup was to download my dotfiles from github. I pulled my i3 config down and used that. I specified the terminology terminal instead of the default terminal xterm for example. I also pulled down a folder of images and had the feh program set my desktop background image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I changed my default shell from the default dash to fish. Since I had installed fish now I had to run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
chsh -s $(which fish)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time I restart the computer that would be the default shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I was on Void rather than Ubuntu the consistency of i3 meant the launching of programs worked pretty much the same as my Ubuntu laptop with i3 (running Regolith, which prepackages good i3 defaults on Ubuntu). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the difference of xbps versus apt, a lot of things just felt about the same as my typical Ubuntu with i3 experience so far, and that's good. Despite the change from an LTS distro to rolling release, a different init system, and package manager the most immediate thing I notice was how blazing fast the system is both installing and launching programs, and for some of the additional and more recent packages I was able to find in void that were missing from the Ubuntu repos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That speed and the variety of software available in the void repos, plus the ability to use xbps-source to package my own programs and the welcoming void community means it feels like a good system to try for a while. I'll continue to use this for a while and possibly post an update if I have more to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-10-27&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is like one of those food articles you find on the internet when you're trying just to find a simple apple pie recipe but instead you find a 20 minute article about someone's grandmother's special childhood apple pie and lots of unnecessary detail. Feel free to skip down to the parts that seem relevant to you, if any :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Linux Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family bought a computer when I was in middle school and I used Mac computers for almost 2 decades. My intro to Linux came when I learned about the One Laptop Per Child computer project. This was the era of TED talks and such, and I got excited, and purchased one during their 'give one get one' campaign. These came out a few years after I graduated from college. Before actually trying one I was excited by the mission, and by the hardware itself. The OLPC XO-1 computers run SugarOS. In some ways it was a fun start to experimenting with tinkering on a computer. For example, I loved playing with Squeak (like Scratch), a smalltalk environment, I believe. I think this may have been when I first tried out the command line and did a short Python tutorial at the Machine Project DIY space in LA. But despite the computer's charm, the rubber OLPC keyboard broke quickly. Sugar didn't work super well for me. I couldn't get much use out of the computer with the software that was on it. It felt limited for making music or art.  I tried out other Window Managers (Fluxbox) and even flashed Ubuntu on it. The computer's clock battery died. With my limited knowledge I lost interest and passed the computer on to someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, I continued to mostly be a Mac user. But after I went back to grad school I saw various websites about Linux that piqued my interest again. Mac was no longer an underdog but a big corporate tool. I was interested in a free and more DIY system. I found some old computers in the trash at school, pulled them out and installed the Arch derivative Antergos OS. I ran it for about a year as a second computer to my Mac. I had issues with borking stuff when running updates occasionally. And the nail in the coffin was when they stopped supporting 32bit systems since that's what my system was. Over time I started using the command line on my Mac, and finding myself in the terminal a lot of the time. One of my professors gave me a copy of Neal Stephenson's "In the Beginning Was the Command Line" and I enjoyed it a ton. Around this time I realized I was spending most of my time either in a web browser or in the command line but I felt limited with the brew package manager on Mac. I was also getting more and more frustrated with the Mac ecosystem as a whole, so when I moved and got a job teaching I ditched the Mac entirely and switched fulltime to Linux. At school I got a Dell and first dual-booted Windows and Ubuntu on it but then switched to Ubuntu with Regolith (an Ubuntu with i3 desktop spin that I've written about previously).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran Debian on my Raspberry Pi's, but I never tried Debian unstable or testing repos previously. Earlier this year was announced Ubuntu Rolling Rhino, which is kind of a hack on top of Ubuntu to get these unstable rolling builds. But I've seen no longterm reports, so despite my interest, it seemed like I'd rather choose something that had more of a track record and community online if I get stuck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I spent more time working on Linux I began to understand better how distros differ. I found myself gravitating to certain preferences which included a large package repository. I also had certain interests in various kinds of computing minimalism, and over time became interested in trying out a distro that didn't use SystemD for its init system. I couldn't wrap my head around how Systemd worked, and I was interested in trying an init system that seemed more in keeping with the small interoperating Linux program philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered Devuan, the Systemd-less Debian distro, but while Debian was very functional for me, it lacked a certain fun factor for me, and I didn't know how well the testing repos would work for me. Alpine Linux I run virtualized on my iPad and iPhone, without a GUI. It's certainly interesting, using MUSL and Busybox, and OpenRC. But the repos are small, and the emphasis of the distro on stability and security feels more suited to servers than my own interest in desktop use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped Arch-derived Systemd-less distros like Artix just because I've already had an Arch experience. While I loved that any and all software was available in the aur community repos, things didn't always work for me and took numerous tinkering around when I used the Arch-derived distro previously. I'm sure with several more years of Linux experience now under my belt I could likely get things going a bit better, but I didn't necessarily feel a draw to 'the Arch way,' and the message boards and community around the distro don't particularly pull me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read reviews of Guix and Nix. These are rolling release and built around a package manager that makes it easier to reproduce your build systems and roll back upgrades if something breaks. But the reviews I read of both of these made it seem like they were fiddly and could use more refinement. I also read you can install nix as a secondary package manager on a Linux system, as a (better) alternative to snap or flatpack, so I could always install this on top of another distro if I so chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting to Void&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that left Void, a distro I've long been interested in but was wary it wouldn't work for me. In fact, I'd tried installing it a year or so previous and had some success on my Raspberry Pi but I just tried running it off a prebuilt Rasberry Pi iso, which is no longer offered. Other smart people I know online have also have struggled with it, and even reading reviews on DistroWatch and listening to various Linux podcasts I've heard others run into issues. But many (though not all) folks who struggled at first and then eventually got it running said their experience after the install was great. So I thought I'd see if I could get it running. (Short answer: yes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what interested me in Void Linux:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;rolling-release packages but fairly stable nonetheless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;not having to build software from source every time (this ruled out Gentoo and Kiss Linux for example)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a non-Systemd init system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'minimal' defaults with ability to customize&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void stuck out to me due to some of its unique choices (custom package manager), its smaller but seemingly fairly active and what I hope is a (mostly) polite community, and the choice to use the simple runit init system. I was interested in trying out xbps. I believe this unique package manager came first, and then the rest of the parts of Void were built around it. I lurked on the subreddit for Void (as well as Kiss Linux when I was comparing) for a few months, reading and watching reviews, and I read through install tutorials and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official Void downloads include base installs, and versions with various desktop environments prepackaged. But they don't have an i3 version, my preferred window manager, so I used a premade iso that I downloaded from voidbuilds.xyz with i3 instead of just the base. In addition to basic i3 packages it comes with a variety of other basic packages including nano, wget, git, qutebrowser, gnome-keyring, adwaita icons, alsa/pulseaudio, xterm, flatpak, pipewire, midnight commander, i3blocks, basic fonts, xrandr and some grub settings, among a few other things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://voidbuilds.xyz/package_lists/i3-x64.packages.txt"&gt;Voidbuilds i3 package list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main idea is that you do pretty much everything exactly the same as a regular install, but this will have i3 pre-installed (and a number of other programs) so you won't need to install it, and you'll just update them with the regular updating process after install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post I'll go step by step (mostly) through the install process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-09-06&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started using Linux systems I was initially attracted to the free cost, its lineage of open source software, and the challenge and adventure of using new tools. I still like those things. But more and more I've come to realize that those feel closer to personal preferences than clear advantages. Sure, free is nice, but open source software is often maligned as kludgy - awkward interfaces, for example, or tools that don't quite work without fine tuning your system settings. To be fair, that does occasionally trip me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one of the huge advantages of Linux that I've learned over time is the composability of commands in the command line. With a few terse words you can coax out powerful tools rather than the amount of time searching in GUI software. And more importantly, you can by its very CLI nature automate repetitive tasks, even complex ones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years now I've done the majority of my photo prepping and editing with ImageMagick in the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Use ImageMagickÂ® to create, edit, compose, or convert digital images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, HEIC, SVG, PDF, DPX, EXR and TIFF. ImageMagick can resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows are some of the recipes I use for individual and mass editing photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Basic image conversion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
convert input.jpg output.png
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Convert and resize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
convert input.jpg -resize 30% output.png

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Convert bulk images without making new files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will take all images in the folder, resize them to 800x600, then convert them to png files&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
mogrify convert -resize 800x600 -format jpg *.png
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dither&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/imagemagick.gif" alt="ImageMagick logo dithered"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;ImageMagick logo dithered&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many dithering options available but here's a simple one I tend to use - it dithers and converts to grayscale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 -colorspace gray -ordered-dither 8x8 output.gif
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Remove white background, convert images to png files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bash script that loops through all png files in a folder, removing the white so there is a transparent background, and re-numbering all image files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
cnt=1
for file in *.png
do
    convert $file -fuzz 20% -transparent white ${cnt}.png
    cnt=$(( $cnt + 1 ))
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-08-7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/dumpster.gif" alt="dithered grayscale image of a digital dumpster in a virtual scene"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last post I wrote about finding a 13-yr old not functional windows laptop and throwing Lubuntu on there and having a 'new' to me snappy computer. In this post I'm writing about re-using 'trash.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dumpster is a generative space for both discarding past images or objects and finding new ones, and new works can be constructed using this detritus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sentence pulled from a description of an online artspace I built for fellow artists and members of my art collective. I haven't really seen online trash space built into networked spaces or communities previously, but it's so fundamental to the way I work that it seemed like a necessary thing to include when I build online community: a shared space for discard and re-use of materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm (IRL) in northern europe with my collective, visiting a museum to do a series of projects. We've been here before and are fairly familiar with the town we're in. One of our favorite places to go is the Reuse Center which is open noon to 1700 a few days a week. We get chairs, dolls, balls, wood, bottles, old electronics, wheels, platforms....these are just off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my home city of NYC there is a space called Materials for the Arts. It's a large multi-story warehouse operated by the city that collects discarded items from city agencies. From my experience it's mostly art teachers that visit to get supplies to use. But the members of my collective (officially a non-profit) usually send 1 or 2 folks a month to go to gather materials for our upcoming exhibits. Things we've gotten there in the past: bucket paint, canvas, old violins, a hot dog vending cart, sandwich board signs, stereos and speakers, phone cases, nails, wood panelling....this is only a small sampling from my memory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say the vast majority of exhibits we've presented featured at least some materials from these spaces, used to build out artworks, the physical gallery infrastructure, for use in performances, and more. In addition, as we move around the city we'll text when we find good usable items on the street discarded, or in dumpsters. At least part of the food we've shared at our space has been good quality discarded from dumpsters: bagels, juices near their offical expiration, loaves of bread, prepared sandwiches...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's already obvious to my readers that re-using capitalist excess helps reduce new consumption. A lesser but still valid benefit is that when you use primarily discarded or waste materials it helps provide a useful constraint around your activities, 'artwork', or other projects, or serves as a starting point for deciding what you'll make next, either as a meal (if it's food), or as artwork or for performances, if it's materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main useable tools for collecting materials for re-use: a large bag, friends to help you move huge things, a bike or other transport, gloves for handling wood or other materials, some previous experience working with materials so you can brainstorm new ones when you see raw materials. It's important to leave behind materials that you don't have a vision for re-use. It doesn't make sense to just move trash along that will need to be dealt with elsewhere. In my city there are Buy Nothing groups, "Curb alerts" people post on Craigslist, and even explicit "FREE, works" -type hand-made signs that people tape to things left on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cities have these kinds of re-use centers, 'free' areas of choice materials recoverd at the dump, and some cities (SF's Recology Center, Philly's Recycled Artist in Residency) even have explicitly artist-run recycling programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-08-05&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: I like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer reports follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RegolithOS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Ubuntu on my laptop for the past 4 years. At first for window managers I had Unity, then Gnome 3. Later I became interested in a tiling window manager. I tried a few out but settled on i3 after some time figuring out how to configure it for Dvorak. Like someone's Vim dotfiles, it's easy to get stuck in a continuous never-complete reconfiguring of one's setup. I added the ability to change volume, change brightness, jump to different workscreen setups, etc etc. But I always had little bugs that would creep in. Probably a result of my particular combo of fish shell, Dvorak, i3, and my audio setups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago I stumbled across RegolithOS, which bills itself as Ubuntu with i3 preconfigured. Surely I didn't need that, I thought. But oh, what the heck, it looks nice in screenshots. Should I try it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an easy install on top of Ubuntu. And I wanted to update my (for shame) old Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to something more recent, to 20 or 22. So I backed up my computer, then updated to 20, then to 22.04 and then Regolith's add-ons. Oh, what the heck, if it brakes, it will brake fabulously I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, nothing was broken. It 'just worked.' I restarted and it was beautiful. I was shocked at how easy and complete it felt. Aside from finding some old documentation out of date (that I reported on their Gitter and then they updated), I found it to be a well-configured i3 setup that required no tweaking. Worked out of the box, including all media keys, brightness, and had lots of great add-ons like a beautiful launch menu pop-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've now been using it 5 months or so and have no complaints, no changes needed. If you like Ubuntu already, find yourself curious about i3, or spending too much time configuring your tiling window manager, maybe this is a good spin for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically Regolith is classified as a Desktop Manager but you can download a preconfigured iso as well if you are starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not even going to throw up a screenshot since my computer looks just like any other Regolith default, aside from my desktop background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://regolith-desktop.com/"&gt;Regolith Desktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Lubuntu on old laptop in DIY recording studio setup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A short report trying out Lubuntu. &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently an artist in resident at a museum. There's a drawer with old tech gear, including mixers, speakers and cables. I set up a temp recording studio to work on electroacoustic music with a friend. In a drawer we also found an old computer, a HP Envy, I think from 2009. It has Windows on it, but I had to start up in Safe mode to even try it out because I didn't know the admin password, and the computer didn't have 'service pack 1' installed which prevented the browser from being updated! When I finally got the darn thing running I saw it had Windows 7. Okay! So my next step: wipe the computer and put a new Linux OS on it. But which one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This laptop I found is 13 years old. So I need a lightweight distro. I guess RegolithOS could work, but I wanted the computer useable by friends here without any previous Linux experience, and I didn't think i3 would be a good experience for them. So I thought I remembered that Lubuntu was the lightweight Ubuntu - so should I try that? I went to the website and read: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The projectâs goal is to provide a lightweight yet functional Linux distribution based on a rock-solid Ubuntu base. Lubuntu provides a simple but modern and powerful graphical user interface, and comes with a wide variety of applications so you can browse, email, chat, play, and be productive. Lubuntu was formerly a distribution for low-end hardware, but we have refocused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They go on to explain in a blog post that it should still be a good distro for reviving old computers but that they will no longer primarily make that their focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe that's a bummer, but let's still give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the iso, wrote it to usb with dd, plugged it into the laptop and restarted. In a minute it was up and running. I double clicked the installer and less than 10 minutes later (I didn't officially time it) I was up and runnig. I had never used Lubuntu before, which comes with Openbox as its window manager, which I don't think I've used before. But it was obvious what to do: Open the menu in the bottom left. I found the menu categories and built-in basic apps pretty usable. I found the qt-terminal, sudo apt updated and sudo apt upgraded, quickly downloaded some basic programs (neovim, curl, w3m, tldr, kate, kitty, amfora, can't remember what else) and some basic art/music programs (krita, audacity, puredata, rhythmbox, love2d).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a 13 year old laptop, the thing is fast. Installing with aptitude is almost as quick as my much more modern laptop. This old clunky computer practically flies. Because I've used Ubuntu so long I didn't feel like I needed to learn anything. I have two complaints so far that I haven't solved: it's not obvious to me how to pin programs to the built-in taskbar. And I Can't seem to get the keyboard keys for special characters to match up with the character printed on the key. My guess is because I use english and this is a european keyboard, but when I tried to switch to danish I still had an issue. It's not an issue for me (i write in Dvorak anyway), but I can tell it's confusing to the other artists here that I am showing Linux too. One person used it in a web workshop I taught and was a little confused looking for forward slash, brackets and the like. But those are the only issues I've had so far. Sound works great. The audio interface I plugged in seemed to work fine. And everything looks pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would recommend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-05-31&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As people are overworked and seek greater and greater degrees of 'productivity' there's an ever-greater need for 'lifehacks' and conveniences to make life bearable. For folk that are overworked, convenience defines many people's work, social and 'free time.' Smart phones enable this to a large degree. Other conveniences are the US food delivery ecosystem; personal transportation via app; meal delivery 'kits'; Zooming versus meeting in-person; texting vs talking; dog walking via service workers; robot food delivery; ordering via touchscreen; fast food (bowls) versus cooking at home. This list could obviously go on and on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people on Gemini and the smol web choose personal forms of digital minimalism such as command line computing, using previous-generation computers, and eschewing modern web computing stacks such as Javascript. Reading physical books versus reading little hits of articles online or social media feeds would be another example of trying to move toward a slow tech approach. About a decade ago perhaps was the rise in popularity or at least trending of articles on the slow food movement, which did seem to decelerate some parts of the fast, unhealthy, unsustainable trends of food consumption, at least on a small scale. I've often wondered in the past how to build a movement around reducing consumption. It's not sexy, per se. It doesn't roll off the tongue. Today I heard a news report on a possible crisis relating to semi-conductors (for some reason, prompting me to think about the CollapseOS project). Should there be a conflict with China then global tech production (including all devices, including cars) would be affected. An international recession would likely occur. There are folks that rue how all new cars are wheeled computers. Consumption is built into the very essence of our modern civilization; if we're not expanding production, and consuming, then we're recessing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we imagine re-making large parts of society not just around performatively reducing consumption the way we perform recycling in the US but around actual largescale personal and societal reductions in consumption? What would a social movement around reducing consumption look like? Of course my utopian view is a non-hierarchical anarchist type reduction of corporate products overall, but I'd even be curious if there's a co-optable vision of reducing consumption. At one point I was more involved in activities like Food Not Bombs, free stores, free schools, dumpstering and the like. In other ways, I still have a minimal amount of personal consumption (no car, don't buy much, try to reduce water usage and mostly cook vegetables), but my guess is that I still use many more resources than folks in other countries, and that my own contributions are more performative than substantial. My fear is there's not a significant way for widescale meaningful reduction in consumption by corporate brands because that's unlikely to bring them more income. But I'm also interested in what a mass movement around reducing consumption would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some current stirrings of a mass movement popular around me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;thrifting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;buy nothing groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;free stores&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;giving up flying to reduce carbon usage activists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cities passing plastic bag ordinances&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mainstream availability of public transit and city bike programs where I live&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else am I missing? Hopefully a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else is needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mass actions and protests demanding increasing funding for public transportation and expanding bikeways and reducing motorways&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;much higher costs for producing packaging and reducing incentives to companies producing new products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;trends and sub/cultures (and then mainstreaming) revolving around re-use and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mainstream media recognition and support (via presenting characters, stories and messaging) around re-use and anti-consumerism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;widespread financial incentives for companies to reduce creation of plastic, throwaway, unrepairable, and closed-source products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;increased financial support and structures of support to enable and maintain cooperatives (businesses and informal communities)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;recognition and awards for projects, technologies, coops, companies, individuals, research and practical tools to enable sustainable repair and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't see much of a wide movement around this right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can artists do to support such a movement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can tech workers, open source contributors, makers, do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What new organizations and communities can form or re-make themselves?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Individuals can make plans to reduce their consumption. I shall set a personal plan regarding consuming clothes (buying used, learning sachiko patching).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities (religious, club, topic-based, etc) can form sharing communities and better hand-me-down protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic institutions can pass legislation to reward re-use, maintenance and to penalize consumption. (This feels hardest to do, but would definitely face more calls to implement if a wide community and social movement comes to pass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with many of your prescriptions, and that it would be good to see something that feels like a "wide movement" in support for degrowth. You might be interested in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-03-31&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-04-01 update: I've added a link to my full code for a player + computer opponent version of the PIG dice game to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-04-06: added a link to a repo with code for my Tiny BASIC games. I have a better opponent AI now, though still quite primitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been getting into BASIC. I was a kid in the 80s and 90s and I remember those computers that would boot into a BASIC interpreter. I didn't have one of those but came in contact with one every year or two and played a handful of text games on them. I was aware of some of the commands and syntax, GOTO and the like, and I have looked through the classic BASIC Video Games book a number of times. The ecosystem of BASIC interested me but I hadn't delved too deeply. Recently I read about Tiny BASIC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tiny BASIC is a family of dialects of the BASIC programming language that can fit into 4 or fewer KBs of memory. Tiny BASIC was designed in response to the open letter published by Bill Gates complaining about users pirating Altair BASIC, which sold for $150. Tiny BASIC was intended to be a completely free version of BASIC that would run on the same early microcomputers. --Wikipedia [1]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So originally, Tiny BASIC was a specification, not an implementation. The People's Computer Company published a newsletter, almost like a photocopied zine to my eyes, with articles, tutorials, comix, all aimed at the nascent hobbyist computer community. They invited Dennis Allison from Stanford University's Computer Science faculty to write the spec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magic of a good language is the ease with which a particular idea may be expressed. The assembly language of most microcomputers is very complex, very powerful, and very hard to learn. The Tiny BASIC project at PCC represents our attempt to give the hobbyist a more human-oriented language or notation with which to encode his programs. [2]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newsletter goes on to describe the motivation for the project, a free implementation of the BASIC language, and the community working on it currently. It specifies what the language could entail, how to solve various problems, a discussion on creating a compiler versus an interpreter, what it will take to build one's own Tiny BASIC, and a request for feedback and ideas. It also contained some simple BASIC games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;All Rights Wronged&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the earlier implementations was Dr. Li-Chen Wang's Palo Alto Tiny BASIC, where he may have devised the term copyleft to describe this process of source code being openly shared and modified and re-published. He affixed the notice "COPYLEFT ALL RIGHTS WRONGED" when he published it in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BASIC flourished as a language throughout the 80s and into the 90s. Many versions of BASIC proliferated, and many versions of Tiny BASIC as well, including some that grew into more extended versions, sometimes including the ability to create graphics or sound, rather than just ASCII text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the inital Tiny BASIC implementations allowed printing text output but couldn't receive text string inputs. These were very simple implementations of BASIC as it had to work with low memory usage. They allowed for (integer) variables, subroutines via gosub/return, if-statements (though not if-then or if-then-else), numerical though not char/string input, and not much else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allowed statements were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
IF - THEN statement
GOTO #
INPUT var 
LET var=expression
GOSUB #
RETURN
CLEAR
LIST
RUN
END
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strings weren't defined in the notes, nor were "remarks" aka comments. Missing also were for-loops, random number generation, arrays, though some of the Tiny BASIC dialects did add these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try my hand at making a simple dice gambling game. Where I grew up Threelo was a popular dice game, and my friends had our own house rules. But to warm up, I first implemented Pig, a good first game to program due to its minimal actions and easiness of programming. Essentially, each turn you roll a die and add the total to your points. You can stop at any time and keep that total, or keep rolling. If you ever roll a 1 you lose all the points you accrued. That's it! Pretty ....(wait for it).... basic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded Damian Gareth Walker's Tiny BASIC Interpreter and Compiler project written in C. [3] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It packages a man page and some example games (Hunt the Wumpus, Tic Tac Toe, and some others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a built-in random number generator, how was I going to create a random die roll? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Gareth published some instructions to construct a minimal not-very-sophisticated random number generator. [4] We don't have the privilege of referencing the clock of the computer for example, so we follow early BASIC tradition and ask the user for a seed number, then perform a simple calculation. Some other implementations of Tiny BASIC came with a random number generator. Gareth's doesn't by default but does add in the ability to use REM (remark) for commenting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;PIG &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's my small and not terribly fun or sophisticated game of Pig. No doubt many improvements can be made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    REM --- PIG Dice game test
    REM --- Created: 2022-03-30
    REM --- Created for cyningstan's Tiny BASIC 
    REM --- No one will want to use this code, but consider it public domain CC0.

    REM --- Variable List
    REM
    REM R - A random number returned by the Random Number Generator
    REM D - Current die roll
    REM T - TOTAL SAVED
    LET T=0

    REM --- Initialise the random number seed
10  PRINT "Enter a number:"
    INPUT R
   
    REM --- MAIN GAME LOOP
20  PRINT "YOUR CURRENT TOTAL IS ",T
    PRINT "Would you like to roll? (0 no, 1 yes)"
    INPUT Q

30  IF Q=0 THEN GOTO 300
   
    REM --- CHECK IF BUSTED
    GOSUB 200 
    LET D=1+R-R/6*6
    PRINT "YOU ROLLED ",D
    IF D=1 THEN GOTO 50
    LET T=T+D
    GOTO 20

    REM --- BUSTED!
50  PRINT "BUSTED!"
    LET T=0
    GOTO 20

200 LET R=5*R+35
    LET R=R-R/6547*6547
    RETURN

300 PRINT "YOUR SCORE IS ",T
    PRINT "GOODBYE"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I've added a link to a 2 player version (player + computer opponent) I made of Pig dice to the links at the end. Source code license: COPYLEFT ALL RIGHTS WRONGED, natch. There are likely errors as this is the first time I'm programming in any BASIC, and I made this in less than an hour, and sure enough, I was making spaghetti GOTO code! But you are welcome to improve or build upon this in any way you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, it would be relatively easy to create some version of Blackjack with a little bit more effort. Of course, it would also be fun to make text adventures, pizza-ordering calculators, the classic text game Lemonade Stand, or a version of my favorite BASIC game TI-83 calculator version of Drug Wars/Dope Wars (that's a story for a different time). To play the game you'll need to download Tiny BASIC. Save the program with a .bas extension. The computer opponent sorely needs better AI than what I've implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a procedurally-generated maze / dungeon adventure game, like a simplified text RPG, called Kingdom of the Lyre that was made for and entered into PROCJAM in 2019. [5] I played it. It's challenging and I thought it was fun. I'd love to have a Tiny BASIC game jam one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, I'll leave you with this WANTED ad from Volume 1, Number 1 of Dr. Dobb's in the section on My, How Tiny BASIC Growed, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-03-23&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likely most folks browsing Gemini pages (or the simple web 1.0 version of this gemlog) will be familiar with open source software and the community around it, if not be an active participant in working on open source software or an amateur historian on its history and many foibles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you weren't? How do you get entry, so to speak?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I received an email, excerpted and anonymized below. The exact software we're communicating about isn't essential to understanding the exchange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;....I've returned to college to finish the BA degree...I'm back in Computer Science classes. For our class project, my group is building an internet radio gadget, and I came upon your **** project. I built it on my Mac, but I don't know how to run it. The doc says "just run *****" but I see no executable with that name. What am I missing? Thanks for your attention!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi X,   *** isn't my project but I wrote a tutorial on it a few years ago. Perhaps you came across that? (see link below). It's a command line application with no graphical user interface and no executable app to launch. It will work on Mac and Linux if you need a command line program, otherwise if you prefer a graphical user interface the free and open source Rhythmbox streams internet radio and is like a much lighter weight itunes or other media player. Best of luck.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more back and forth emails ensued as I pointed out some more resources, then X wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem is that there is no resulting file called ***. I've looked and don't find an obvious candidate but I'll look again. Maybe I can find someone involved in the project. Thank you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since it's open source software, it's not considered best practices to contact the developer of the software this way. The onus is on the user to get it to work. Often times a little bit of debugging is required. Best to work with a local expert that can help you, such as your professor. I'm not on a Mac, so I don't know where it's installed on your system, but usually to launch it you would type: . Your linux skills will increase over time :) Some linux tutorials can be found here:  Technically, the Mac's built on a modified version of BSD but it's similar to regular Linux command line. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X replied, saying their professor wasn't familiar with how to work on software this way (which surprises me) and thanking me for explaining this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so at this point, I don't really remember my first steps in finding out about and using open source software. I've been using computers for almost 30 years and was a user of "shareware" games and software in the 90s, when I was a teen. I've been programming for less than a decade, but I can't remember my initial steps in Linux and open source software. My guess is that, like now, I spent hours each day reading tutorials and books, reading in forums, and testing things out. Perhaps my biggest learning moment was when I found an old computer in the trash at grad school and tried reviving it and installing various Linux distros and software on them, which to my surprise worked successfully, albeit with some challenges along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it felt funny receiving that initial email from X asking for help, even if or especially if I had been the creator of the software. My hackles were something like: "how dare they try to reach out for help from the creator, the audacity!" But if you have no prior experience with open source software, how do you know the norms, culture or best way to get assistance? A lot of forums in open source software have aggressive or even hostile communication patterns for newbies. I don't blame someone reaching out to the person they thought created the software. Certainly, with commercial software, that's likely one of the steps a consumer might take. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I reached out to X saying I was following up to see how they've made out. They wrote me a nice note and told me they came across VLC and wrote their first little bash script to launch it and play some sound files. I wrote back and congratulated them on sticking with it and finding a solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a specific general prescription here other than some general open questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are more ways to help newcomers to open source software get help?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how do we help beginners find out what's available? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how do we help them learn how to use (and debug!) software? (many tutorials assume more advanced knowledge)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also open to hearing feedback on different approaches I could have taken to this email exchange, or suggestions for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-03-19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do shabbat almost every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's relaxing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not deeply religious per se, at least in the faith part, though I am deeply jewish. Most of this manifests in my reading (Jewish Currents, a leftist jewish magazine with great political and cultural analysis and critique), cultural knowledge and community (anything from Curb Your Enthusiasm to attending jewish talks online throughout the pandemic), conversations (talking to fellow members of the tribe), who I communicate with (I went to a university connected to my community, my first girlfriend later became a rabbi), the culture within my family (I grew up in a jewish community), and the community I live within (same today), as well as celebrating certain holidays (my faves: passover, purim, tu b'shvat, the 'high holy days', and of course shabbat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without this cultural context, I still think shabbat is pretty incredible. Each week on Friday night I know where I'll be and what I'll be doing. I'd also say it's low key. At its core it's just a meal with the set addition of wine/grape juice, candles and bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what it means practically for me: Every week I have dinner on Friday nights with my neigbors. Usually earlier in the week we'll run into each other, or we'll be hanging out and make vague cooking plans, or we text the day of and just say what we'll make. Occasionally a friend or two will also join. Often my friends want to roast a chicken and I usually bring a big salad, and we'll have challah bread, wine and grape juice and beer, and maybe potatoes, green beans, or something else. Occasionally we make tacos because we like them. I think once we were all so tired we ordered a pizza. Incidentally, we live a mile away from one of the most famous pizza places in the country, Di Fara's Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic this was the same group that was in my covid 'bubble' for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we do this every week. So there's not much to figure out. Especially during the pandemic's worst days when there was nowhere to go, this was a dinner to look forward to each week and really 'made' the weekend. Shabbat is great because it's the end of the 'work week' and the beginning of the weekend. It helps demarcate time. And like all great jewish holidays, or maybe any holidays, it revolves around a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally I'd finish whatever I'm working on around 4 or 5pm on Friday and then start cooking. Occasionally I made my own challah bread, either starting the night before or earlier in the day to let the dough rise. But most of the time I'm cooking fish perhaps, making green beans, salad, eggs, or something else. I try to figure it out earlier in the day so that I can run to one of the local markets within a few blocks of my apartment to pick up ingredients. Sometimes I just bring the stuff over to my friends and we cook together there. If I'm trying a new recipe I make a few different things in the off chance something doesn't turn out, but it's almost always been okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 6 we put on polka music, and that's just a tradition for us because we listen to the local radio station WFMU and that's what they play at that time, and it feels like a connection to the 'old country' even though klezmer is more accurate. The first half hour I usually play a game with my friends' son, or I help cook, or set the table. We usually have flowers too. Occasionally I run out to the corner store to get sorbet or wine. There's a particular cheap but good wine we usually get, and I've stocked up enough of it that I don't usually need to pick it up. I'm slightly embarassed to admit it's a canned oregon wine we like. But it's the perfect amount for our small group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we've assembled, we're hanging out. After a while, maybe the food is finally all ready, we sit down. Candles, bread and wine are traditional. Blessings can be optional, obviously, but we do them. It takes a minute and contributes to the ritual. We start by turning the lights down, sing the blessing and light the candles. Then we bless and drink the wine and grape juice. I'm not a big wine drinker so I just have a little bit, or have grape juice mixed with seltzer. Then we sing the blessing for the bread and pull off chunks to eat. There are a number of bakeries near us that sell good challah bread. I don't eat a lot of bread in my life, so this is a treat for me. Then we eat the meal. I don't know what we talk about but we eat and talk for an hour or two, slowly. At some point, we stop and play with the kids again, then take turns cleaning up a bit. The kids retreat and go to bed. Then most of the adults continue hanging out and we may watch a movie, or play a game or just keep talking. Somehow 5 hours have gone by and then I head back home with leftovers for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's how we do shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as more of society around us 'opens up' and there is starting to be more activities and such, and even though I'm single and pretty socially active, going out many other nights, I am still reserving Friday nights as shabbat night. It's our ritual, and a fulfilling, simple and pleasing one at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-02-20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics: consumption, photography, 'toy' cameras, analog emulation, the aesthetics of deterioration, creative constraints, bigrot, #GLITCHFEMINISM, Beyond Resolution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I espouse anti-consumerism and consumption, I do occasionally buy things. Most recently this is a new-to-me camera. As an artist I am drawn to working with tools of creative expression. I tend to spend lots of time researching before I buy anything new, and I try to buy used (often Ebay) and local (thrift stores, Craigslist) when possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I irregularly follow the work, writing and photography of Grant Peterson of Rivendell bikes. Last month I spied some beautiful photos, seemingly shot on film, I believe on their Instagram. It listed the camera as a Papershoot, which I looked up online. I have film photography experience going back around 22 years; I took a lot of camera and darkroom classes in community college and university, and in workshops afterwards, and I used to shoot a ton of film on a collection of old analog cameras I collected at thrift stores at desert shops and swap meets in southern california. I did not recognize the camera name, so I knew it was something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Film photography seems to me like any other artistic-craft skill: there are those that 'geek out' on the technical aspects more than the artistic choices; there's the ability (curse) of getting obsessed with accessories; and then there are those that don't care about these things but treat their camera as a means to create the artwork they see in their head and wish for the quickest route from idea to artistic execution of that idea. I am overly simplifying but hopefully this is a useful way to break down some of the approaches around photography and other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/basket.jpg" alt="Dad"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Dad's film camera in my bike basket, 2008&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the community college darkroom courses, the focus was definitely on the technical: How many f-stops? how long to process? How to do light metering and how precise is your light meter? These areas felt so over-emphasized to the degree that I felt like the artistic aspect (what you shoot, how you frame, how you can experiment in the processing, and the poesis of the work) was perpetually left behind. We were constantly pushed on the technical skills and the photography field's classic definitions of photographic perfection. Did you get the full range of black to white? Does your composition use the rule of thirds? Etc etc. How many more classes would I need to take to get to the discussion of what we were shooting instead of these technical parameters? One could argue it's always important to learn and refine one's technique and that it can be taught hand-in-hand with artistic critique, but I never felt like that came. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these technical courses I also took classes with names like "High Art vs Low Art" and "Breaking the Grid", which were more experimental courses where we tried lots of techniques, studied artwork, documentaries, experimental film, sound art, sculpture. These are unique classes that were offered at the private undergraduate university I attended. In these courses was little discussion of precise technical creation of our works. All discussion were focused on the ideas. These courses attracted a great balance of genders and allowed those with lots of technical expertise as well as those with relatively little technical background in artistic disciplines to share space as equals. This is largely the way I like to teach now as well in the public university I work for, though I am often required to teach 'straightforward' technical courses as the intro classes to get to these upper level courses. That makes some sense to me at times, but I also like to break this down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the time of my undergrad university courses I picked up the posthumously published The Journey is the Destination, The Journals of Dan Eldon. Eldon was a British-Kenyan photojournalist working throughout the African continent. His journals combined hand written text journal entries, collaged drawing, snapshots, and collaged and treated photography. This book opened up a door in my head. I think subconsciously I've been influenced by this work to such a large degree and in many ways my digital work making games, flatgames, or other artworks are partially indebted to his body of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was shortly after the time that I became really obsessed with pinhole camera photography. I attended workshops at a museum during a weekend program, I believe aimed at children. They had empty Quaker Oatmeal containers, sealed shut, with photo paper inside, and an aluminum foil pinhole in the side. We took photos by placing the camera outside, set up and aimed at a scene or still life. Then you open the lens by removing a piece of electrical tape to let the light in to 'paint' the film paper inside. After waiting an amount of time based on guesswork (30 seconds? one minute? hard to say!), we closed the lens, brought the camera into a darkroom, and processed the photo paper in the development baths. I was in love. This would have been around 2002 or 2004, around the time personal digital cameras were about $150 - 300 on the low end. These pinhole prints were the opposite. Not only were they made of free materials, they were not pixelated. They were distinctly not attempting to replicate the eye or even what we could see on a digital screen. This produced images not super-realistic but rather expressionistic or even impressionistic. It was something new. The outcome was unknown as we waited, but shooting with the pinhole camera was an attempt at painting with light, and channeling an artistic medium that favored both prior experience AS WELL AS dumb random luck. There's something about this combo that feels like the important space I like working in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved up and bought a large format (this refers to the size of the film) wooden pinhole camera. It was expensive for me, and I used the cheapest student film paper and film to shoot black and white images. In my community college darkroom courses I ignored the professor's assignments and used my limited darkroom time to process these pinhole film prints as contact prints. In other words, rather than use the photo enlarger to project and enlarge and then process and print technically-proficient 35mm photos I experimented with large format contact prints. I loved working this way, and would bring the photos back to my studio at a local warehouse in the desert, where I hung and 'exhibited' my photography, and photocopied and made zines of the work. Some of my photography was also shown at a local museum and in local art galleries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around this time I started to become familiar with 'toy' cameras. Not cameras meant for children, but cameras that had their own peculiar constraints, or really, 'failings.' These were almost like cousins to pinhole photography. The first one I learend about was the Holga camera, which I discovered while looking for a medium format pinhole camera to purchase that was affordable. A plastic lightweight camera that is really cheap with plentiful used ones to be found? I learned about the various Holga camera options with plastic lenses. And in these days, pre-twitter, pre-facebook, there was a lively movement of photographers on Flickr.com. I spent hours flicking through, commenting on others' photos, and using the forums to learn various techniques. At a local swap meet I finally found one for sale. For years I used this inexpensive Holga camera, producing unexpected results, goreous images that I was proud of, true collaborations between me and my camera and the light and the subject and the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2010 I bought an iPhone. Over time I stopped carrying my cameras on me. I stopped pulling out my pinhole camera. I moved around the world. I didn't have a home and lived out of a backpack. The cameras would take up precious space. I shot on my iPhone and posted to tumblr, facebook, then instagram. I also tried VSCO, which emulated analog film photography but in a cutesy 'street style photography' format that became popular around the same time. This is my recollection at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped shooting film. I traveled around the world and mostly shot photos via my iPhone. I didn't have consistent income. Then I was employed again but my art practice had shifted. I wasn't using photography as a creative medium so much as a documenting medium. I continued to shoot photos ("make images") with my iPhone, sometimes to unexpected delightful artistic heights. But photography had become tertiary in my art practice and more about documenting or representing moments of my life presented for online consumption. And that seemed to be the case for most others I knew. This is also when I was getting into programming. As I learned to program in Processing, a relatively early thing you can learn after the basics of variables, functions, loops, conditionals, is working with the camera. You learn about 2dimensional arrays, and looping through the pixel grid. I enjoyed making Chuck Close style camera software, which I think many would now call a 'filter.'&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/lines.jpg" alt="Self-portrait created with colored lines, camera software in Processing"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, these were fun experiments, and I love my artistic practices now, but I do miss my camera as an always-ready fount of inspiration and discovery. For years I used a point-and-shoot fashion camera with a beloved Carl Zeiss lens. But I have no desire to work in the darkroom anymore, breathing in toxic chemicals, and I don't love the process of sending my photos out for processing and printing at 20 to 25 bucks a pop anymore. I thought occasionally of the Holga, and had checked out 'toy' digital cameras like the Superheadz Necono digital camera (a camera in the shape of a cat, taking 'lofi' digital photos). Shooting photos on my iPhone and using an analog-style filter wasn't that compelling to me. There's too much else around it: the web browser on the phone, text messages, the unlimited possibilities of options, especially since these apps like VSCO often make their money by charging for additional 'filter packs.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump ahead and I discover the Papershoot. I've spent a bit of time researching the images shot with it. Sometimes the images look like analog film to me, though perfect emulation is not particularly important to me as such; it's the 'warmth' of analog-appearance that appeals to me, crossed with the artifacting and degradation appearance that adds a certain color or something extra to the images. Like a traditional film camera, there is no screen to display the image. When you take a shot, there's no way to see the image until you plug the camera in to the computer to unload your shots from the day. The camera offers 4 settings: color; black and white; sepia emulation; blue - which I think is vignetting, dark corners, and a color shift - reminiscent of something like the Holga's plastic lens and weakly light-proof camera body effects. I waited a few months and found a used one on ebay. The thick paper (cardboard?) body is wrapped around a thin camera circuit board. The paper has an image of an analog camera on it, a silly mimemis, though other 'cases' could be purchased. I'm enjoying shooting with it, having no expectations, and embracing the unknown. Like the old days, I jump on my bike, sans phone, with just the papershoot in the pocket. Would I use this for documenting other artwork I make? Probably not. But that's okay. I'm having fun, letting this constrained tool take over. My area of 'specialty' is now constrained to where I aim. Do I move forward, backward? When do I snap the shot? Which of the 4 emulation filters? And then I forget about it, and wait the week or two until I plug into my computer and rediscover where I was, who I was with, and find magical works I channeled from the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past two months I've been playing off and on working on a photo emulation process. This isn't complete, but started by a question I posed to myself of whether I could make a camera that emulates some of the discovery and magic of using a photocopier. I love the black and white images full of distortions, fragments, ruptures and fuzzes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. Itâs the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still working on my bigrot photocopy-ier software, and who knows, maybe it will turn into its own camera, or zine software, or something else. I'm enjoying creating something new, beyond precisely capturing the world, adding in random number generators that distort and disrupt my photography. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly recently I'm seeing artists reading and embracing Legacy Russell's Glitch Feminism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Glitch Feminism, however, embraces the causality of âerrorâ, and turns the gloomy implication of glitch on its ear by acknowledging that an error in a social system that has already been disturbed by economic, racial, social, sexual, and cultural stratification and the imperialist wrecking-ball of globalizationâprocesses that continue to enact violence on all bodiesâmay not, in fact, be an error at all, but rather a much-needed erratum. This glitch is a correction to the âmachineâ, and, in turn, a positive departure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queering our discourse, art practices, institutions and our technology is a much-needed critique and experimental corrective that has a lot of beautiful implications and experimentations, even for those of us of dominant sexualities, genders and other identities. Cameras can be tools for liberation, for example by embracing of 'othered' bodies, as well as a way to rethink and question societal norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rose Menkman's scholarly work she writes about glitch as praxis. Her most recent work The BLOB of Im/Possible Images asks us to imagine creating an 'impossible' image of any object or phenomenon that you think is important, sans any constraints. She posed this to scientists, then created an exhibition of works inspired by their answers to her questions. This process of making tools and artworks and exhibitions guided by conceptual and artistic areas of interest is deeply inspiring to me, and guides how I want to build both tools and frames such as exihibitions or publications or websites to present the works created by the tools I make and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my bigrot project unfolds, I hope to absorb some of the lessons and practices of these works, and I look forward to discovering new forms of glitching, breaking, disrupting, photographing and remixing and re-seeing through the lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-01-05&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I have so many links in this post that I've placed them all at the end and just list the link number inline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of software, music, events, blogs, podcast episodes, candles, programming languages and primarily videogames&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Gemini - Although I started browsing Gemini in fall 2020 and posted my first posts in November that year I really came to love it in 2021. It expanded, new tools developed (like my fave: Antenna, the front page of Gemini for me), and I now have a loose community of blogs that I read and people that I communicate with through email after having found each other on here. I love hearing from people that read my writing. Thanks to everyone on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Fediverse - Fediverse overall and the Merveilles.town [1] instance I'm a part of are my new social media addiction over the past year, maybe more than Instagram, but it doesn't feel soul sucking. It feels good. Great community of programmer nerds interested in permacomputing, tiny languages, noise music, loops, livecoding, building in nature, living at sea, etc etc. Dispersed around the world. When I have technical questions of a particular sort, this is the place to ask it. I mean I'm not gonna go on Stackoverflow and ask for help writing a RSS generator in shell or Lua. Lotta dudes though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Em Reed's writing [2] - Writes on video games, tiny tools, overlooked technology history, and other nerd shit. I mean, she writes on topics I'm interested in, but she's better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Wolf Eyes [3] - I never really took a break from listening to Wolf Eyes since I first read about them in the Philly Weekly in 2004, specifically one of the musician's being hit in the head with an ax at a concert and being rushed to the emergency room. If that's not a "The Boredoms" level of commitment, what is? Anyway, I was intrigued and checked em out playing a basement show at the First Unitarian Church I think, or maybe at a gallery? Idk. Anyway, they fucking ruled. Pretty sure I never opened for them or anything when I was active in noise music, though I did play with their collaborator John Weise. Sometime after like 2007 or something or maybe 2010 they had a lineup change and rocked less and I stopped listening for a bit, and then I lost all my CDRs pretty much when I travelled around the world for a few years and left my shit in my mom's uncle's house-garage (he lives in a garage of a millionaire. You should see this fucking garage. It'd be a mansion in New York). Wolf Eyes' members had Handson Records and AA (aryan asshole it stood for) and i think the third dude was Gods of Tundra but I didn't collect their tapes and CDRs. Anyway, I mostly got rid of my old CDRs and many didn't work years later and I don't have a CD player. So anyway, what I'm saying is that I paid for a few bandcamp albums, pirated the ones I had bought years earlier but didn't have anymore, and then used youtube-dl to grab a bunch of live shows, then make a fake streaming radio station type thing, which is really a random playlist that triggers playing wolf eyes music on my computer whenever I want, and I'm fucking enjoying listening to them all the time while working on art shit that needs some concentration but I'm not in an ambient mood. One of the albums, live at Banfields I think, is just like 25 minutes of recording of them having stage banter and then getting off the stage, no music. I paid for it without listening since all their albums sound the same, like Phish I guess, but anyway, fuck it, glad I have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Infinifactory - Yes this game [4] came out in 2015. I bought it in december on GOG since it was 50% off after watching a youtube vid on Zachtronics game where the creator shows why they are just brilliant and goes through the intro of Infinifactory showing how you get into the game and how expertly crafted it is. It made it seem very approachable, as opposed to the TIS-100 game I bought, a Assembly game that I was excited about but didn't stick with. I've been playing so many block puzzle type games this year - haven't finished Baba is You, got fairly far with Draknek's Cosmic Express [5] which reminds me I have to play more of the PuzzleScript version Train Braining [6] that came first. All this is to say, Infinifactory is a gorgeous well-crafted puzzle game. You're a kidnapped human that alients are forcing to build little factories to generate unknown machinery. I'm about halfway through the game, that I casually play for an hour or so a few times a week. There's some mystery where all these dead humans are scattered around and I think I'll either get killed or defeat the aliens but it's also separate from and not really needed if you just like puzzles but I'm enjoying the two together. Kind of like how the Human Resource Machine [7]  is a programming-type assembly game but also about humans vs. robot overlords. Anyway, I'm primed to love this type of game and I certainly do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. Aerofoil [8] aka Glider PRO, a game I LOVED as a kid in the 90s. I had this on my family's Performa 475. I just sent it to my sister. It has the two player mode! Maybe we can play it again. You're a paper airplane flying through a house with steam vents (to rise), killer cats, alarm clock bonuses, random drips that'll kill ya. All's you can do is press left or right with the arrow keys. This game is perfect. There's a level editor too. Incredible. Play this game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. thecatamites [9] possibly the best game maker of all time is releasing so many tiny games over and over that are incredible worlds. Why haven't you played them all? THis is a question for me too. I need to play all of them and not do any other work. I just downloaded Crime Zone, his 2013 game and it's as thrilling at 3am now as it was back THEN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Increpare [10] took a break releasing games from January 2020 to June 2021 and now he's back with a vengeance. All difficult puzzle games in PuzzleScript mostly, mostly abstract puzzles but many funny theme ones too. Even though I usually can't get that far I enjoy trying them. Maybe I'll unlock the solution some day. I got pretty far in Subway upholstry snot smearing championship [11] and Swimming Time [12] is so NSFW. I beat it once but not again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. Occult Spreadsheet Synthesizer [13] technically came out in the past day or so of 2022 but was largely made in December for the Glorious Trainwrecks Secret Santa thing that I'm also participating in but haven't gotten my game fully popped out yet. It's a spreadsheet synthesizer, you should probably play it. For fans of the occult, spreadsheets and synthesizers in any combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10. Fujichia's 2021 Movie Roundup [14] which was my inspiration for doing my own 2021 best-of list here. I'm just going to quote one of many brilliant reviews:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Ponyo (2008): Rewatch of this dynamite flick. So refreshing to see a great movie with a cool weird rich world, in which no one ever tells you details and you simply do not require them. Of course there are a million questions you could ask, from "who's that guy" to "why is this happening" but we don't ask those questions because we're not nerds, we're people enjoying a beautiful moment. Even the people in the movie don't know what's going on! That's really inspiring-- everyone just rolls with it. If this movie was made by a committee like most modern movies they'd insist that audiences need a stand-in character to constantly ask questions and be perplexed. Luckily this particular movie was made by a tyrant. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11. Lua - Yes, the language was born in 1993 but I only started programming in a version of it (well, really, Pico-8) maybe 2 years ago. Now I'm playing with Love2d as well, and even writing some Lua scripts for some simple applications and games on my own. I love it. It's like javascript if they froze the spec, didn't constantly change how the language is written, made it less popular, made it faster, made it simpler. A perfect language. It's even 1-indexed. Surprising! Seriously, I started working on some web projects recently and wished I could just write Lua instead of JS. Maybe I can make my own sub-set like JavaScript the Good Parts did but it's not about being 'correct' and instead about being straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12. PuzzleScript - did I mention this previously? Yes. [15] The greatest funny little game engine. Just try it. Even if you don't think you'll love puzzle games. We need more code engines and tools like PuzzleScript. Integrates a pixel sprite editor as ascii art in 5x5 grids of text. Sound creation is random intuitive beautiful brilliant. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13. The Dawn of Everything - David Graeber and David Wengrow's anarchist omnibus on the flexibility of pre-modern civilization. Inspiring. Exciting. Purposefully provocative and essential reading. Yes I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14. Tildegit [16] - It's the tilde world's answer to GitHub. Many of my new personal projects I host here instead of GitHub. Clean. Simple. There is a tiny explore feature and surprise surprise it's all tiny smol-web projects like Gemini servers and the like. It's not GitHub, it's not run by a benevolent asshole for life. Works great for daily use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15. My 10-year old Nook Simple Touch e-reader in combination with my bookmobile [17]  software to convert articles from the internet to epubs. I want to make a reference to Us3's line "We be to rap like key be to lock" about bookmobile to the e-reader "but honestly," I'm telling myself, "please don't."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16. Ezra Klein interviews Noam Chomsky [18] - Yes I'm a Chomsky stan. Went to see him speak multiple times in my undergrad and he came and spoke at my school as well. I didn't follow it all well then but now yes yes yes. I can't summarize everything he says in 2 sentences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;what weâre talking about is the massive extraordinary effort that goes into creating wants, shaping opinion, ensuring that doctrines are not questioned. A separate question is whether it works. Well, thatâs a mixed story. Sometimes, it does. Sometimes, it doesnât. But underlying it is the fact that one of the major factors components of our social order is a huge attempt to manufacture consent to create wants, to ensure doctrinal conformity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17. The Book of Delights by Ross Gay - started 2021 with this book because I needed some delight in the small things and honestly I need some again. This isn't a big idea book but sometimes small light beautiful little cozy things are nice? I kept a little list of delights for a minute. I got into this only because I heard Ross reciting his delights on an episode of This American Life. Great voice. Maybe I'll start adding some delights to my daily diary (my minilog) I keep for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18. Candles - I have soy tea lights and various candle holders and it's giving me life this winter. I did shabbat many friday nights of the pandemic, cooking for or with friends, followed by a movie or video game and beer or other smokables. Good tradition. Hope we can continue if omicron wanes a bit. Anyway, I learned while visiting Denmark just how much candles can increase the warmth-feeling. They use candles everywhere, even in summer, and I looked online: Danes are the highest per capita candle users. Soy candles are less pleasant than paraffin wax, but they don't produce harmful soot. To my initial not-extensively-researched-yet eyes there are some arguments between soy vs beeswax candles, which also don't produce soot. Soy production can use lots of chemicals and lead to deforestation. But bees can be over-farmed (is that the right word?) as well, so it seems like maybe a tossup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19. Thrive [19] - I paid into the Kickstarter I think in 2020 but it shipped in 2021 and boy it was worth it. I love this game, a "build your own chess piece" game. Innovative 2 player board game, and it now has a iOS app [20]. The creator Martin Grider has a website with his blog posts, games and talks. In particular I recommend checking out his talks, where he gets into the secret sauce of board game design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20. Mike Tyson's intro music to his fight against Spinks in 1988 was an excerpt from a song by industrial band Coil for a famous match (that he won in a minute and a half). I randomly only learned about it recently. See this article from the old AnimalNYC [21] in Animal, where you can listen to the full track from Coil's How to Destroy Angels. I mean I don't think I have any interest in boxing whatsoever except for this song and Tyson's beyond atrocious extremely serious so terrible it's charming 'primitive' face tattoo. So I guess I'm just a huge Tyson fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm forgetting a million things. Stay tuned for more. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-01-05&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the process of playing Infinifactory, a 2015 puzzle game from Zachtronics games. So far I love it. In the game, you've been captured by aliens and are forced to build factories of complex objects using basic element blocks, conveyor belts, sensors and such. The game does a lot with very little. Levels are minimal environments with a few starting blocks and some available tools for the player to build the puzzle solution. I highly recommend it. But that's not the focus of this post. One night before bed I read Zach-like: A  History of Game Design [1] , a compendium of notes, design documents and sketches from the game design career of Zach Barth, director of Zachtronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book Zach writes about the time after he shipped Infinifactory; he decided to bootstap a computer from scratch, starting with development tools and working up to an operating system. He has headings in the write-up on Our Backgrounds, Project Goals. Between his goals and the section on his Pandora Playlist he lists Project Rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like everything I do, this project needs arbitrary, self-imposed rules&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to list them, and I think they're interesting, but I'm not as concerned here with the specifics as much as the main idea that that constraint breeds innovation. It may seem obvious when so clearly stated, but I know personally it's an idea I frequently forget. If we agree that constraint helps place a context and restricted choice aids in focusing our creativity, there is an obvious question as to how to choose those constraints. One of the things I love in Zach's phrase was the use of the word "abitrary." In other words, there isn't a logical decision-making progress but instead an ad-hoc selection. A bodily incorporal selection or a hunch, no doubt. Humans are not logic machines: why shouldn't an arbitrary series of rules produce great creativity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I try to create a game in Unity, I've noticed my own tendency to get overwhelmed. For this reason, I started using smaller game design tools. I've written a previous post on the constraints of PuzzleScript and my love for it. [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also found myself gravitating to writing in Markdown and Gem-text, using CLI programs more than graphical ones. So it's with pleasure that I recount some of my favorite tools or constraint systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some examples of constrained design systems:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;the Pico-8 fantasy console&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pico-8 console is a pseudo-1980s console system with limited screensize, pixel drawing program to create sprites, limited code editor, sound creator, sequencer, map editor.[3] It is designed as a cohesive system that specifically limits the scope of what you can create in order to allow you to concentrate on your ideas and go from idea to exececution swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You code in a limited form of Lua, and all parts are integrated together. It's a beautiful way to make a small game project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dogme 95 Vow of Chastity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogme 95 was a Danish film movement (dogme means dogma in danish) created as a manifesto with "Vows of Chastity" by Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg.[4] The vows were rules selected to focus on straightforward storytelling and acting without using special effects or technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three vows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The camera must be hand-held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more vows and a postscript and according to the filmmakers they wrote it in about 45 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Uxn and the Varvara computer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uxn is a virtual machine and ecosystem created by Hundred Rabbits. It is a 8bit virtual computer, influenced by Forth machines, programmed in its own Assembly language instruction set. It provides an underlying core for the Varvara computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With only 64kb of memory, it will never run Chrome, TensorFlow or a blockchain. It sucks at doing most modern computing, but itâs also sort of the point. It's more about finding what new things could be made in such a small system. [5]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Towards Minimalist Game Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An academic design methodology by game designers Andy Nealen, Adam Saltsman, Eddy Boxerman [6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Minimalist games have small rulesets, narrow decision spaces, and abstract audiovisual representations, yet they do not compromise on depth of play or possibility space. We begin with a motivation for and definition of minimalist games, including terms such as "rules," "mechanics," "control," and "interface," and illustrate the importance of artificial design constraints. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Micro Fiction Games Jam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created and hosted by James Chip, Micro Fiction Games Jam has now been held two years in a row [7].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By very short format games what we mean is any game (ttrpg, larp, tabletop...) that will fit entirely in a single tweet (280 characters). Games must be actionable! once someone has read the game text they should be able to infer how the game is played and be able to go ahead and play it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my new favorite things to look forward to each year. I participated with two entries (under two different pseudonyms :) the first year, and didn't participate the second year but have tried several out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Disquiet Junto&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week for the past decade Marc Weidenbaum has sent out on Thursdays his weekly Disquiet Junto emails, a recipe, rules to be used to create a piece of experimental music. [8] Participants who elect to participate follow the rules, create a short 1-3 minute piece of music, and upload somewhere on the internet and link to it from a discussion forum. The short prompt provide the arbitrary conditions to spark an idea and allow creation to blossom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;why_small?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why small? is an essay/game about the creator coleo_kin (Em Reed)'s "interest in small things." It's created in Bitsy, its own constrained adventure game-making tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Many more examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many more examples. Several months out of the year I particpate in one-a-day projects (like inktober or noisevember as just two examples, along with my PuzzleScript-a-day in December). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this listing and realization of the importance of constraint will be a helpful tool for me in this new year. As I work on projects and embark on new ones, I am setting an intent to consider arbitrary or intentionally-selected constraints and use these to focus my energy, excitement and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022-01-01&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels funny to write January 1, 2022, but it is, by only a few hours. I got home from a tiny party with friends, just 4 of us for New Year's, since the Covid situation is really bad here in my city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being stuck inside alone in the winter sucks. I am doing my best keeping busy with my projects in art, code, music, organizing, biking, cooking. But it feels like a long time of doing the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago I started doing daily code sketching. Basically, free coding on art, websites, generative art, games, or whatever I'm feeling like. Sometimes I'm active for weeks at a stretch where I code every day for hours. Other times I might do something once a week. My average is about one mini project/toy/sketch/artwork/thing every five days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago was the launch of The Present, a seasonal clock conceived of by Scott Thrift. A clock to remind us to slow down, to check in with occasionally. In this clock, the hand rotates around once over the course of the year. The clock is filled with a conic gradient, from indigo to blue to green to yellow to red to purple and back to indigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I'm an indoor urban dweller, the clock is also a designed minimal representation of the seasons passing (yellow summer, red fall, purple / blue winter, green spring). That sounds a little silly, a bit of a strange simulacra, but the minimalism is appealing, a calming effect, a meditative moment that I find in some of my favorite architecture, like the buildings of Louis Khan, the design work of Italian designer Bruno Munari, or in the software-art-work of graphic designer David Reinfurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the project but at the time was living on the road with no income, and I didn't want to pay $50 or $100 or whatever it cost at the time. But the idea stayed in my head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I began semi-daily code sketching one of the first things I coded was my own web version of this seasonal clock. I've grown as a programmer since then and would probably improve the hand mechanism now, but it works. I'm also thinking about potentially getting a tiny monitor and keeping this mounted somewhere in my apartment. Adafruit sells tiny 1" TFT displays, but I don't know if I want to port my css/query code. A simpler idea would be to repurpose an old phone with a web browser, keep it plugged in and turned on, or the NTSC/PAL (Television) TFT Display 2.5" that plugs into the old Raspberry Pi B+, which I have lying around here unused currently. I'm open to other ideas too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ctrl-c.club/~lettuce/season"&gt;Season clock running live on the html version of this gemlog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thepresent.is/pages/year"&gt;The Present season clock by Scott Thrift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'm enjoying the hand hovering from purple to blue, marking the present moment in this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-12-30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few others have been writing on Gemini about consuming articles and gemtext offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's two tools to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Offline Gemini Browsing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ploum built the AV-98-Offline fork of AV-98 client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tildegit.org/ploum/av-98-offline"&gt;AV-98-Offline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't want to browse offline, it's a better implementation of AV-98. Updated search engine, and output is automatically piped to less if you are viewing more than a page of text (press q then enter the number of the link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Offline HTML, Reader, Markdown and Epub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/bookmobile"&gt;Bookmobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my own take on offline archiving and reading. Download articles for offline viewing as simple HTML, themed html, epub or markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the readme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a brute force fishscript (shell) gluing together pandoc and a Node.js package that implements the Firefox reader view. It uses a NPM package implementing Mozilla's Readability script to scrape off ads, sidebars, footers, headers, etc. If that's not the right solution for you, jump down to the alternatives section at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I use this as an alternative to Wallabag or Pocket to download articles I've meant to read later, converting them to epubs with bookmobile. Once a week I drop them on my micro-sd card and load it in my 10 year old offline e-ink e-reader (a Nook Simple Touch, ultra-cheap on eBay!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for just browsing on my computer, the html output is really nice. In the default, it just applies readability to strip out all the junk. But in the reader format you can apply one of the nice simple CSS themes (medium clone, my now theme, simple pandoc, github clone, gemini clone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is over a hundred lines of fish script, so the code is pretty wonky, but it works for me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-12-28&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past month I've made over 20 games with the PuzzleScript game engine by Increpare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://puzzlescript.net"&gt;PuzzleScript website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html"&gt;PuzzleScript editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PuzzleScript is a small game engine that runs in a web browser, originally created in 2013, and now up to version 1.7. It was originally designed for sliding block turn-based type puzzle games (aka Sokoban-style games) but can be used for other genres as well, including realtime games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PuzzleScript's design is a cohesive, intimate coding environment. It works in almost any graphical web browser. The editor has a drop-down menu with 18 full games that you can load, modify, and run. All games have a player character and out of the box pressing the arrow keys moves the player around on the screen, which can be modified. Games can be shared through the browser, using a free Github gist repository, or games can be exported and self-hosted on a website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PuzzleScript's web based editor is a work of genius. If you open the editor, you'll notice distinct sections all on the same screen. At the top is meta information like the creator, game name, color palette. Below that you create your sprites as simple quasi-pixel art. Each object in the game is made of a 5 by 5 grid of color blocks. You specify an object name, colors, and then use numbers to represent the color of each pixel. The number comes from the order of colors specified in the line after the object's name. These become the sprites you use in creating your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example player sprite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
Player
Black Orange White Blue
.000.
.111.
22222
.333.
.3.3.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hair at the top (000) is black (and will appear that way in the PuzzleScript editor). The face below (111) is orange. The shirt below that (22222) is white. The pants are the 3s, blue. The periods represent background (empty space). If you were looking at this inside puzzlescript those numbers would be colored with their represented pixel color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/puzzlescript.jpg" alt="screenshot of a puzzlescript level with player from above pixel code"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;screenshot of a puzzlescript level with player from above pixel code&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the objects name in the OBJECT section or inside your LEGENDS section you specify a character to represent each of your sprites. For example I'll specify that the letter p will represent the player:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
p = player
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other sections in a game file include the Rules section, Win Conditions, Sounds, Collision Layers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the top right box of the editor is the play section for testing out your game. There is a visual level designer here as well if you click level editor button, that lets you draw your level sprites to the screen and then save as an ascii file to paste into your levels section of your game file. In the bottom right quadrant is the console. which prints out error messages or other compilation messages. Between the game play/level editor and console is a tiny strip, the sound creation toolbar. Clicking on one of the sound category buttons generates an 8bit sound sample randomly and prints its numeric code in the console. If you like a sound you can copy its number and paste it into the sounds section of your game file and assign it a rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most complex section of a gameplay file in PuzzleScript is the rules section. In this section is the meat that defines how our game mechanics functions. This mini domain-specific programming language is based on a simple idea: The game engine will look for any specified match on the left side of any game rules. Then it will transform that match into what's found on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example will serve to illustrate what that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the following basic rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
[ player bomb ] -&amp;gt; [ bomb ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left side of the arrow (-&amp;gt;) is a player and a bomb in the same space. If the game engine finds this condition anywhere on a running game at any time, it will transform that space containing both a player and bomb into just a bomb, which is what we see on the right side of the arrow. In other words, the bomb destroyed the player and only the bomb is left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's modify this a bit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
late [ player bomb ] -&amp;gt; [ deadplayer ] sfx0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this version, when a player and bomb are on the same space, the bomb disappears (we can imagine it exploded) and the player has been transformed to a deadplayer, presumably with altered pixel graphics from the regular player sprite. And we also play the sound effect zero (sfx0), which we've selected from the sound generating section and placed into our SOUNDS section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our SOUNDS section may look something like this now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
=======
SOUNDS
=======

sfx0 85319102
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word late added before a rule means that the rule is run after a regular move has occurred. So that way, this rule will run immediately after a player has moved into a space with a bomb and not on the following move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a basic movement rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
[ &amp;gt;  Player | Crate ] -&amp;gt; [  &amp;gt;  Player | &amp;gt; Crate  ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this rule, on the left side is a player moving toward something (that's what the &amp;gt; indicates). The rule looks for a moving player next to a crate. We know it's 'next to' because the rule specifies the player and crate are separated with the | pipe character. So this rule looks for a moving player, moving toward a crate square. The result of this is a moving player next to a moving crate, both moving in the same direction. In other words, if a player moves toward a crate, the player moves forward, and the crate it moved into moves along the same direction, getting pushed one space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
[ &amp;lt;  Player | Crate ] -&amp;gt; [  &amp;lt;  Player | &amp;lt; Crate  ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this variation, the player is moving away from the crate (notice the direction of the &amp;lt;), which results in the crate moving toward the player, like its getting dragged along behind. This rule doesn't specify the direction, so if a player moves up away from a crate, it will drag the crate up behind it. If the player moves down away, it will drag the crate down, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the basics, and there are many more rules to be learned in the well-written PuzzleScript documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/documentation.html"&gt;PuzzleScript Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the game rules, there is a section called Win Conditions. A typical Win Condition might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some player on target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No demons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To win each level a player must kill all the demons and get to the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section of a puzzlescript file is the levels section. A creator builds out the levels in ascii using a single letter to represent each of the objects (sprites) from the objects section. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between levels it's common to have full screen text messages, such as instructions or a storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My puzzlescript process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually start informally with a loose concept for story or game mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I do the puzzlescript version of 'grayboxing'. In 3d modeling game design this is the process of building out your 3d world but entirely with gray (or white, etc) boxes, and placing in your first person controller. This lets you immediately have a playable world you can walk in. You can immediately start testing out gameplay dynamics. And you can start placing in 3d models to replace the gray boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My puzzlescript version of this is to start with just a few primitive boxes. For example my OBJECTS section might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
========
OBJECTS
========

background .
transparent

player p
blue

wall #
orange

book b
blue
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets up 4 kinds of blocks, gives their ascii code that I can use them to draw out a level and assigns a single color to represent them as a block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
=================
COLLISION LAYERS
=================

background
wall, player, book
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets up a dynamic that the player, wall or book can't be in the same space. So a player could bump into a book, but can't stand on it, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I may draw a level like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
=======
LEVELS
=======

########
#......#
#....b.#
#.p....#
#......#
########
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll start without any rules or win conditions. So out of the box I hit run and can use the arrow keys to move the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tiny little room. Let's add some rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;puzzlescript
======
RULES
======

[ &amp;gt; player | book ] -&amp;gt; [ player | book ] message You pick up the book. It's Labyrinth, by Jorge Luis Borges
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left side of the text arrow -&amp;gt; is the condition. On the right side is what that condition causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left side says "any player moving into a book" and the right side says "results in the player still standing next to the book" and then prints the message there to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not yet even remotely a fun game yet, but there are many possibilities for development now going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My love for PuzzleScript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love any game-making or coding environment with good presets and delightful constraints. It's a perfect 'rapid prototyping tool.' Like fantasy consoles such as Pico-8, PuzzleScript's constraints help shape the outcome, encouraging small ideas that can be iteratively tested and modified and played again. In fact, PuzzleScript feels like a 'smaller' tool even than Pico-8. Having the drop-down menu with premade modifiable games, a built-in player controller using arrow keys, and the one-click sound effects creator all help with the quick release cycle. Working in a web browser means the tool can be used without having to set up a coding environment or installing anything. And the one click export and share features make it easy to share one's game, complete with a 'hack' option that lets players open up and remix your own game file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presets on PuzzleScript are smart. Each game has a title, author and optional link to a website. The only way to have text in a game is using the message command, which allows one to tell a story or give simple instructions. The only 'action' button possible beside the movement directions is the X or Spacebar action key, and the ability to undo or reset is built-in automatically, or can be turned off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrated development environment and quickstart options makes the tool strong. Increpare has done the hard work of debugging and making it all work well together. Since he's created it as open source, a number of forks have been created with added features, and tutorials are available around the web. A great community of game-makers have grown around it, and games can be found on itch.io, Increpare's own PuzzleScript games, a PuzzleScript email list and elsewhere. Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-12-10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed up to make a game for someone as a surprise for the Secret Santa 2021 event on Glorious Trainwrecks, a website for experimental lo-fi game makers that's over a decade old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first learned about Glorious Trainwrecks from reading Rise of the Videogame Zinesters. It's from 2012 but still relevant. In the book, Anna Anthropy describes her journey to becoming a game maker, her own particular approach, and a variety of games to try out (possibly a slightly dated list that may be harder to find) as well as suggested low-entry no-code or low-code tools to make a game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I code now, I still love a lot of low and no-code tools as well, and I enjoy using a lot of different engines, languages and tools to make games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Glorious Trainwrecks website most folks tend to make games with a variety of these kinds of tools, and create a motley assortment of strange experimental little games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a full extensive list of experimental, strange and alternative game creation tools I recommend visiting the Game Making Tools wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gamemaking.tools/wiki/"&gt;Game Making Tools Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some of my favorite game-making tools that I've used and continue to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinychoice - a browser-based tiny branching narrative creation tool. As easy as writing gemtext or markdown. You write text in your browser, add something to indicate rooms/branches, and something else to indicate options for navigation, and that's it. When you're ready to distribute you click share and your game is live at a URL, or you can download and self-host the complete html file. I've even modified my game's style by adding in a CSS stylesheet, which allowed me to make a cool custom text game. This tool is by Increpare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitsy - A great tool by Adam LeDoux, works in the browser. Allows you to make 2d tile-based adventure games where you walk around, bump into characters and have conversations or explore a little world. Great for experimental narrative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scratch - "Kid's software" to learn programming, out of MIT. Also works in the browser. A 'lego-block' like coding framework where you drag your blocks into the editor and can re-order. This is more coding than the above, but still friendly for beginners. I made Scratch games and toys when I was trying to learn game creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puzzlescript - This one is also made by Increpare and runs in the browser. It's a tiny little game engine with code editor, sound creator, console, and test screen to run your game. You draw your game objects and characters by writing a small ASCII image in text, assigning colors. You then use a visual editor to stamp your objects onto a level, or you use ASCII again to manually create your level. You writing rules for how the player and objects move, and that's the most complicated part, but there are a variety of pre-made games that you can open up their code and copy and paste in or modify what you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klik and Play / Clickteam - Klik and Play is --80s software-- (UPDATE 2021-12-12: It's from 1994 actually, which is still dated but not as old as I thought.), but still has a following online. You'll need to run it in an emulator (which exists for Mac and PC). Like Scratch, it comes with a huge library of sprites images you can drop into your game. Uniquely, you don't need to code but you assign behaviors and click to play your level. As things collide, run off screen, you hit a key, etc, it pauses and asks you what game behavior should be assigned to trigger next. It's a really cool way to build a game. Games made with Klik n Play can only run in an emulator, so it's harder to distribute games this way. The company behind it still exists and they make a variety of tools, such as Clickteam Fusion, a more modern but somewhat less intuitive tool. It's still fun though and some people use that. There are a variety of free and paid versions of Clickteam available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katelabs - A very new tool, created by Kate Barrett. Still in active development. This is a tool to make small 3d worlds. Runs on Windows only at present. Comes with a ton of built-in 3d models and at present no scripting language, but allows you to make a surprisingly large number of worlds. The 3d models are somewhat lower fi, but a nice aesthetic. Games can be distributed but must be run with Katelabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p5.play - A tool originally by Molleindustria, currently unsupported but still functioning. It's a library to stack on top of p5.js for those doing creative coding with this javascript framework. It adds in methods to use sprites and collisions. Still used for making 2d games, very simple ones at that. There are a variety of example files you can use. I wouldn't say it's the most intuitive library to code in but I have lots of p5.js experience so it sometimes can be useful for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flatgame Maker with Unity - Unity is the big dawg. Useful for making 2d and 3d games. NOT beginner friendly. I don't love Unity. I am interested in learning Godot, the open source 3d game engine in fact. But both have a higher start-up knowledge required. One thing I recommend, making a flatgame, a 2d handmade little story world to explore. There are starter files you can use by Dreamfeel and a new plugin Flatgame Maker module they made that runs in Unity to facilitate making a flatgame. I'm looking forward to trying that. I still think would require some knowledge to get started with but give it a shot. There are various flatgame tutorials for beginners on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, will update. I checked the Wikipedia and it says 1994. Also, was surprised to learn that Five Nights at Freddies and Baba is You, two games I enjoy, were made with its Clickteam Fusion successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-12-11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't so much a critical review but more of an overview of a certain genre of experimental documentary or personal narrative characterized by a practiced informality that sets the tone and form of the work. It's prompted by my recent watching and enjoyment of the new TV show How To with John Wilson. Admittedly, I've only seen a few of the episodes, but I was immediately smitten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a typical episode John has a loping voiceover. There's a minimal premise: he's trying to buy some wine for a party, or decide whether to buy his own apartment house when his landlord wants to move and sell it to him, or go on vacation. He's always alone but wandering the streets of New York city. We don't see him but out the lens of the camera. He comes across people, sitting on the ferry, arguing in public, carrying huge odd objects down the street, offering free energy drink samples, getting their cars towed. People speak to him and the camera. People with bad teeth, strange clothes, uncommon interests and fixations. And for a moment he veers into their world, letting them tell their own stories or expertise, from proponents of a conspiracy theory that says our history has been rewritten but preserved in memory to a subculture built around energy drinks to the subculture of superfans around the movie Avatar. John intercuts this with short snippets, Instagram-sized in length, of the effluvia of New York City street life. It's a shaggy dog story and the scenes veer from one conversation or view to the next until reaching some final brief fanfare on the title of the episode with nary a logical throughline or narrative arc. In this way it defies all previous television and film to my mind, with the exception of the non-narrative of the Eric Andre show (minus the antics, personality and stunts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize a bit of myself in John, or at least, I recognize some of the same situations and feelings of getting lost in little moments of life. Not just because he's filming the streets of New York City during the pandemic, the gross subway, the ridiculous situations and people that are characteristic of New York life, the mundane dollar slice pizza, subway trash sculpture installations, mishmash collage storefront signage, pigeon shit realism - it's also the fact that John's about my age, used to live in an artist warehouse in my old neigborhood, and currently lives in a neigborhood that I know well. In each scene or moment of the TV show (shot in subway, on the streets, in restaurants, on the ferry...) I keep thinking I'll recognize myself or one of my friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooming out a bit, the show is in a lineage with Louis Theroux's anyman film-making as well as the mundanity of the Fishing with John TV show with John Lurie. It has some of the self-centering of Karl Ove Knaussgard with a bit less blathering and maybe a bit less cockiness. I recognize some Werner Herzog without the gravity. And photographer Alec Soth's genuine love for the overlooked corners of America. I'm also reminded of some of the gonzo journalism that took off in the 1960s. Or prior to that was Studs Terkel's book Conversations with America and later his radio interviews with 'common' Americans as well; maybe that's the closest in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these programs star a middle aged white man. My friend was agitated by this and expressed disinterest when I described How To to her. From her perspective there's a particular privilege with framing one's own narrative as worthy for other viewers/listeners. I get where she's coming from and I'm thinking the show probably couldn't be made the same way by a marginalized person because they wouldn't be able to get in the door or be given the basic respect that John is privileged to receive as he bumbles through his encounters. The show's producers includes celebrated writer Susan Orlean (The Orchid Thief, The Library Book), and other writers as well, along with producer Nathan Fielder (Nathan For You). I wonder what they do in their roles and how they shape the show. Could the show work as well for me if one of them was the 'host'? Possibly, though it would probably be a very different show, as it feels like an extension of John's personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm really enjoying How To with John Wilson, but it also reminds me that what I want are many more kinds of John Wilsons, stories that seem to shoot out of nowhere, not following a particular path or narrative arc, but just revealing moments of lives, a better view of what the world may be like than what I'm seeing elsewhere on TV or in the news, and where we all feel invited to enter to talk to each other, no matter how distant we all seem from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-11-30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not a professional programmer. I use it to make art, procedural generation, games, small utilities for myself, personal automation scripts, websites, social software projects. I also teach programming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my journey to learn to program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOGO - as a kid I did not know anyone, child or adult that programmed. I did not have a computer and there wasn't one in my school. But I was interested. I got a book from the library about LOGO. I read that book even though I couldn't play with the language without a computer. I think my school got a computer when I was in 4th or 5th grade and it did not have LOGO installed. I only remember Number Munchers (early 90s). But reading about LOGO began to teach me computational thinking in my head. I was also into Chess as a kid, building chess sets. I remember drawing a connection between the movements of chess pieces to the idea of moving in a grid of coordinates in LOGO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forth - I also got a book from the library on Forth. I was likely around 12 years old or so. My mom was going to college and we got a home computer, a Macintosh. I had no idea how to find the Forth language or get it installed on my family's Apple Macintosh home computer since it wasn't available as a box for sale at the computer store, which had limited and expensive Macintosh software for sale in shiny boxes. I found one of those shareware CD-Roms with hundreds of games at the store, and it was for Mac! WOOHOO! This was incredible. My sister and I played these all the time. So many wonderful memories of exploring these weird games. There was a 'robot' fighting game (these simple colored circles) that you could write scripts for and have them 'battle'. Again, these were like simple circles that would battle each other in a top-down view. This was a Forth-like language as I remember. I struggled and could get only a basic robot script to work. If anyone knows this game or things like it, please email me and let me know! Would love to revisit. Would have been mid-90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FutureBasic - I read about BASIC online. It sounded like a good beginner language. Since I had a Mac I could only find FutureBasic for Mac available at the store. It was expensive, $40. My mom bought it for me for my birthday or Hannukah gift. I couldn't figure out how it worked. It had an IDE, which I didn't understand, and no introduction, and it worked completely unlike the 80s books on BASIC that I found at the library. My mom asked a friend's son to help me. He had some programming experience I think, maybe VisualBasic for PC, but he couldn't figure it out either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pascal - I took a computer science class in high school taught by someone that I do not know if she could code. I think she was a substitute teacher. She had a workbook of sorts but I did not learn anything. I played Snood and similar games instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this had all been a failure. I didn't learn to code, didn't know how to learn, and decided to do art, music, sociology, writing, biking. That consumed most of my life for a long time, over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python - Well after college, almost 10 years later, I wanted to try to code. I visited the FreeCodeCamp website and did tutorials. I learned about variables and maybe a few things like loops or conditionals. I found the Turtle module and made LOGO-like mini little tests. But I found Python boring. Or at least the tutorials I was reading. It had me compute various things like number of days, prices of things, text calculator app, etc. Ugh. I moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: links here are all http&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html"&gt;Python Turtle Graphics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scratch - I read Rise of the Videogame Zinesters by Anna Anthropy. I was inspired and wanted to make weird games. She describes no-code tools and I was excited to try them. She also described code-lite (not a real term I don't think, just using it) engines and tools, including MIT's Scratch. I had read about the Lego Mindstorms system, which allowed you to build and code with LOGO, developed at MIT's Media Lab, but my family couldn't afford it. I really longed to try it. But I learned that MIT had transitioned over time to working on Scratch. I made some games with Scratch, a children's drag and drop lego-like language to make interactive projects. It worked as a desktop app (Flash) and later online in Javascript. I made simple and strange games and diversions. I also tried out Puzzlescript, which is a minimal engine to build puzzle games, and other tools by Increpare like Flickgame. I was drawn to the strange and supportive community of Glorious Trainwrecks, a website for other misfits building games in 2 hours or less, with all kinds of hacky, jokey, strange, experimental results. I met great and supportive weirdos in the forum on that site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms"&gt;Lego Mindstorms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/"&gt;Glorious Trainwrecks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickgame.org/"&gt;Flickgame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.increpare.com/"&gt;Increpare games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing - On some nerd blog, maybe something like BoingBoing I read about Processing and learned there was an experimental intro workshop being taught by one of its co-creators Casey Reas. Although the workshop was taught in another country, the workshop materials were online for download. It sounded exciting. In the workshop, participants, who had no previous coding experience, were given the code of a clone of the 80s game Breakout, and then told to try changing things to see how that would make new forms. In essence it was breaking and hacking the code of this game to make experimental visual art. They published example images and gifs. I downloaded Processing and the starter code and figured out how to get it to load. Then without understanding any of the code I tried changing numbers, deleting random lines of code (I really did not understand much) and got sizes to change, colors, new number of balls, angles of bounces, etc. It did produce some wild and strange stuff. I was interested! Should I try to learn this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went online and bought a copy of the Learning Processing book from Daniel Shiffman. It arrived. I started reading the book and trying it out on my computer. I learned variables, functions, loops, conditionals. I made very simple frogger-like games. Later, I attended one of the first iterations of the School for Poetic Computation and did a 2 week workshop program, meeting other artist-programmers. It was eye-opening. Afterwards, I was excited and was working at a hackerspace in my home city. I kept learning, and started teaching. I became interested in Bash because I got a Raspberry Pi and I started to learn about Linux. I taught some intro workshops in Processing and Bash. I started to learn about Arduino. I was having fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p5.js - I went through grad school, did more coding, and was a TA and eventually started teaching. At this point I had to finally learn object-oriented programming, which had tripped me up previously. Teaching meant that I had to learn myself, and I learned so much while trying to help students. Things started to become more intuitive and I was having lots of fun. I was doing code sketching and making installations and games. I started to learn Unity as well, though I did not find it as intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can fast forward a few years from there. I'm still teaching, full time, and love learning too. I've been delving into lots of languages, subject of a future post. For a while I concentrated solely on Javascript, as I'm interested in presenting my work on the web, so I put a few years primarily into mastering that. But I've since branched out to many other languages like Lua, C#, a little Forth, some Python for machine learning. I love constantly learning and challenging myself and teaching others. It took me forever to learn to code, but I don't regret it, I just wish I'd found another entry point even earlier. If anything, I'm glad I felt encouraged to become an artist, writer and musician. I think you can learn to program at any age, and it's best if you have other skills and interests as you can bring that to your programming interest (and be a more 'whole' person, if you will).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-11-16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini protocol is a great way to participate in a type of pre-figurative politics of building the society we want to live in. This post is an attempt to start or continue a dialog about intentions for this gemini space many of us float in, and to build community dialog around our goals for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of posts around the gemini specification. I think that's well trod ground and I'm personally going to move on to the intention of the community, for how else can we avoid the mistakes of other protocols, decentralized software and communities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us on Gemini have strong political opinions. These opinions are often narrowly focused around privacy, technological sovereignty, the freedom to 'own our data', gather and make digital space and communications without behemoth corporate platforms. This is a great start. Can we go further?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on a lightweight technology means it can theoretically be adopted by those with less technological and financial resources. It can also be a great system for many communities, individuals and groups but in practical terms we are missing the documentation, tutorials, diverse leadership and other supporting systems to help diverse communities enter and use Gemini. Here's some ways I'm thinking we can try addressing these. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Documentation and promotion &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want a more diverse group of people on Gemini, we need to build documentation, resources and promote it to people in other specific communities. We also need more places for communication around building and promoting these resources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group, multiple groups, or network of individuals could engage in this, and organize through Gemini posts, an email list or other location. Because IRC is already a tech-space, it may not be the best space to do so however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of beginner-friendly documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoEI6VzybDk"&gt;What is Gemini? by James Tomasino (YouTube video)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I appreciate Solderpunk's Gemini Protocol Documentation. I think additional resources could be created specifically to target non-technical users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/"&gt;Gemini Protocol documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recruiting communities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who else would be interested in Gemini?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we have some low-hanging fruit of groups that could be welcomed into Gemini to expand our community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;those groups or individuals interested in non-corporate platforms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;groups or individuals interested in publishing text in particular (versus images, videos primarily)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;groups and individuals with an education focus, interested in trying new things out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;folks disillusioned with corporate media and open to experimentation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a definitive list by any means. Some examples of communities to welcome to Gemini follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Activists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although TOFU, Gemini's built-in method for Trust On First Use certificates may not be the most secure system, its tradeoffs will have to be weighted against a competing important interest of activists: self-controlled/owned spaces free from the restrictions, spying or marginalization of tech spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How activist communities be brought into the space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tutorial videos, intro documentation on hosting a gemini capsule, perhaps even a server instance aimed at activist or political groups/writers. This should be seeded by a number of activist groups that can be given some resources such as training, some funding to pay them an honorarium for their own time and knowledge, and ongoing support to help them host their knowledge bases such as wikis and articles. Individuals or collectives within gemini community could step up to financially and organizationally start this in a very bootstrapped manner with a minimum of resources. A type of mentorship could be set up that intentionally supports and quickly empowers in particular: women and non-binary folks, and groups of politically-oriented tech-focused groups in the global south. For example, a quickstart method could be to piggyback on the various alternative and DIY tech conferences such as Our Networks, Radical Networks, but also and perhaps especially the conferences aimed at these potentially-adjacent activist communities such as Allied Media Conference. Imagine intro workshops at these conferences built for these communities or organized like a wikipedia edit-a-thon meant to help set these groups up in a 1 1/2 hour workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ournetworks.ca/"&gt;Our Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radicalnetworks.org/"&gt;Radical Networks &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amc.alliedmedia.org/"&gt;Allied Media Conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other communities that could be welcomed and encouraged to join in this way. It likely will take someone or a group of people that are partakers of Gemini protocol who are also engaged in an additional hobby or community to specifically build resources and welcome in their own communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Disability Community Inclusion &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini's text-focused orientation could be a boon to support those with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there clients with text to speech? Are there resources built by and for those Blind/Visually Impaired? What about resources for those with other accessibility needs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many accessibility issues and we can support those with the knowledge to publish best practices and provide support for inclusion. There are many ways we can be supportive of the Disability Community. I don't have background in this myself so I'm hesitent to share too many ideas here and hope others can continue this dialog and brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Education communities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been teaching Gemini in my comp sci classes. It's easy for this group to get started, use and build clients and read capsules. Is there enough content for them yet? Are ther posts oriented around younger people? Not as such yet except perhaps for e-worm.club which appears to be a lot of participants in their early or perhaps mid-20s. I don't remember how I stumbled across it, but it appears to be a bit over a year old, fairly active like a tilde community, and has a number of young people including voices that are not just male voices in the space. Again, I don't want to proscribe what we should do other than to say we could provide certain on-ramps for educational-based communities to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gemini://e-worm.club"&gt;e-worm.club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neocities does a great job of providing scaffolding for young people in a friendly environment to join the internet with their own created content. Its a model that a potential host could follow. In fact, I messaged the admin of Neocities last year about the possiblity of hosting Gemini capsules but they aren't involved in this space and felt like it was outside their focus. I still think it provides a good model. Neocities hosts a lot of subculture content, is open source, provides a way to surface new content, allows web and CLI interaction, takes donation and recurring payment but also allows freemium use and features a supportive community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://neocities.org/"&gt;Neocities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://neocities.org/tutorials"&gt;Neocities Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Community Statements and Codes of Conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with welcoming more communities in, let's reduce the influence of toxic parts of community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this be improved? Create a code of conduct and a statement of values for the mailing list or any other semi-official channels or public forums or spaces that people set up that explicitly sets the tone and guidelines for the community. This will make diverse communities feel safer and respected. This code and/or statement can list the expectations for being a participant in the space and the repercussions for not following these basic principles. Then it can be followed and community caretakers could privately message folks and/or publicly respond to an infraction and then take further action if the behavior continues. Folks operating public directories of Gemini capsules may want to consider taking this action as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://p5js.org/community/"&gt;p5.js Community Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Invitation to dialog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a rambling post with some thoughts on expanding Gemini's community. I'd love to hear more ideas, responses, feedback and see any of these start to take root and grow further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-11-16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a post about how I make choices as to who I try to boost or platform, with an emphasis on try. It's not a manifesto or a cut and dry proscription. And I'm open to receiving feedback on this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding of the term 'platforming' means to show respect and endorsement of an individual by giving them space to publicly speak their views. This could vary from something as 'minor' as a retweet of an individual to as much as conducting an extensive interview with someone on a public podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background info: I am a mid-career artist and academic, white and cis-gendered male, and a member of a minority culture, based in NYC, who works broadly in technology. I am also a volunteer and organizer with several arts organizations and run a podcast. I have a fulltime job, housing, and a supportive community around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where I boost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are the places that I can make choices as to how to boost/amplify?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the classroom I choose what artists or scholars I teach, add to my syllabus, or have students read and research. I meet with other academics and share syllabi together, attend art and technology conferences that feature diverse presenter communities, and I try to assess my syllabi. I believe I can still improve my work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my podcast I choose which guests to invite to speak with me (about 3000 active listeners). I have put effort into presenting a diversity of voices, ages, genders, and cultures. I am still however very focused on cities, western voices and can take more steps to change this. In general I try to amplify speakers that are not already given widespread platforms, though have compromised on this at least once in order to amplify a person well-publicized already but where I had a unique body of knowledge to gain new insights beyond the traditional press. Choosing more well-known guests with social and cultural capital would amplify and boost my own podcast, though it does not match with my goal here necessarily and so I haven't taken those steps but instead try other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the art spaces where I am a co-organizer I have a hand in selecting artists we present in exhibits, to host performances, hold events, or boost on our social media. The organizations I work with have put sustained multi-year efforts into diversifying our community, leadership and allyship in a way I am proud of. I do believe we need to continue to put energy and discussion around this to make sure we continue to support marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of social media, my podcast, personal accounts and arts organizations have about 15,000 direct followers. I choose what to amplify, such as a re-tweet of someone's project I'm excited about. This feels lower stakes than a podcast episode or a web article for example, but it's still worth considering our influence and platform power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this gemlog I have about 15,000 monthly views. I don't know how many are bots. I choose what to write on, and I keep in mind my audience is largely a technical community with diverse interests in art, music and other hobbies. I keep this gemlog mostly separate from my other projects and tend to not platform people but instead ideas, concepts and occasionally software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing about software, I consider the community that creates the software. In general I will try not to say who/what I won't cover because I think inadvertently that still amplifies someone I don't wish to give a platform. Examples of this include: particular software communities that make minimalist software but flirt with neo-"fash" or neo-reactionary politics; game developers that espouse anti-vaccine misinformation; free software communities that rally behind benevolent dictators with mysoginist messages. This is not a comprehensive list but just examples. These groups don't need any support or amplification and I won't write about them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implications of platforming/boosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe giving a platform or boosting someone sends the following types of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

"Here's what I find interesting or important and worthy of my and your attention..."

"This is a model example that I wish to follow..."

"We need more of this in the world..."

&lt;p&gt;Here's how this fits with my politics: I believe in non-hierarchical organizations and direct democracy where we as people find compassion to work together and support each other. I don't want a leader or leaders to make decisions for me or about me or about the people I care about. I don't want to amplify the voices of celebrities, 'charismatic' leaders, those with social or economic power or cultural capital. They already have support and don't need more and certainly not from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm open to modifying my views and actions, and interested in hearing about how others make decisions. Feel free to write a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-10-25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I visited two different European countries: Germany and Denmark. In Berlin, I was shocked to see how many public parks were in the city. I used a city bike program while I was there and biked all over the city. Parks were plentiful, large, well-maintained, well-used, covered in trees - like mini forests. There were public pools and adventure playgrounds, concert areas, picnic grounds, public workshops. Of course in addition are many public plazas. Most plazas have shopping all around, but the parks were usually a respite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even outside of parks and plazas, there is plentiful public seating. Benches. Chairs. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Denmark the number of parks is enormous. I found parks with outdoor free rock climbing walls. Free food distributed to families each day in the playground. So many bike paths. Canals. And yes, plenty of seating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in New York City and frankly most cities and suburbs in the US it's impossible to find public seating in most places. If anything, there might be a bench in front of a business, for use temporarily by customers, but even that is rare to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live near a major, beautiful public park, and moved to this neighborhood largely because of the park. The park does have benches, but not that many, and even those often feature anti-homeless features to prevent homeless people from sleeping. This is (written cynically) ostensibly cheaper than providing mental health and housing support services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where can you sit? You can sit on your own porch if you're lucky or wealthy enough to have one. You can sit on a restaurant's chair or bench while you're a paying customer. You can sit on the ground in a park, which is difficult for the elderly and disabled. Or you can purchase a portable camp chair for $$ and carry to a public place, but usually a parking lot outside a concert or stadium, a beach, or campsite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago my neighborhood had an old-fashioned community yard sale. This kind of thing feels rare in New York, to have coordinated between neighbors. At one of the large houses nearby I saw they had out what looked like church pews and old seats. They had what appeared to be pictures from magazines cut out and glued all over the benches. I didn't know if they were for sale or what the story was. I didn't explore. I just biked on by. Imagine my surprise the next day to see these pews and benches and seats pop up all over the neighborhood. The seating has appeared where it's been missing: in front of an apartment building, two outside of a laundromat, one on a busy street. And of course, they are always filled with people. At all hours of the day you can find people sitting, resting, talking. One time I saw an unhoused man sitting, asleep on a bench. And so what. The next day he was gone and others were sitting in his place. I've been wanting to photograph them but they always have people sitting on them and I don't want to photograph people in public. So I returned in the late evening to take some photos, when less people are out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's great to see this ad hoc urbanism. I'll be curious to see how long it lasts and if neighbors can take care of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of community or country can't provide seating for its people? And what does that say about the society and the role of its government and who it serves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-10-01&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about and talking with some friends about the form of my music recently. When I say form here, I am specifically thinking about the output: how is the work presented to a 'public' or community? I tend to construct a kind of semi-elaborate generative modular system, tinker with it til I love what's happening, then let it play and occasionally nudge it while it spools out ambient and experimental music in various ways. When I really enjoy what's happening I hit the record button on my external recorder. From there I listen back later and make selections, and arrange these in an order, come up with track titles and an album title, and select a photo for the cover. Then I 'release' it to Bandcamp without much ado. Additionally, I use my music as background for games, visual art, and interactive art that I make. And recently I have begun to perform live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I've had the hunch that an 'album' doesn't feel like exactly the right output for my sound work. It just captures a moment, but as the creator of the system, we crave surprise/evolution,  like creators of roguelike games.  This must also be why Brian Eno released an 'app' versions of some of his albums as well as generative sound-creation software with his collaborator Peter Chilvers for Opal Limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/exquisitecorpse.gif" alt="Cadavre Exquis with AndrÃ© Breton, Max Morise, Jeannette Ducrocq Tanguy, Pierre Naville, Benjamin PÃ©ret, Yves Tanguy, Jacques PrÃ©vert, 1928"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My performance/music name is ExquisiteCorp, a reference to the surrealist drawing game Cadavre Exquisite/Exquisite corpse, which I used to play as a sort of party game in high school and college with my friends. For those unfamiliar, everyone starts by folding a paper into thirds. Simultaneously, all participants draw a (absurd, unique) head  on the top third. After a period of time, everyone folds over this area of their paper so it's hidden and then passes to the next person. The next period draws the center body section without glancing at the top head section. After a while everyone folds over again and passes to another person who draws the bottom section / legs. After a period of time, all drawing ceases and we open the papers and share our drawings of exquisite corpses to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I referenced this game because of my love for collage, musique concrete, merzbau, assemblage; all the forms of constructed collage in various media that I enjoy. This 'exquisite corpse' recipe I hoped would be an influence on the music and sound that I create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Other 'shapes' beyond albums&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are other forms to 'present' and share this work? what are the other forms that exist or new forms that could develop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various examples of alternative forms for generative (and I'll say improvised) music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apps with playable versions of  systems and minimal / specific interface, like the above-mentioned Opal Limited apps like Bloom or Scape &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Game pieces like John Zorn's Cobra - A set of orally-transmitted instructions for a raucous live performance of a concert of improvisers playing with conductor. Various signs, hats, calls are used. The group works together to make music but there are adversarial positions the players can take as well. Various perforamnces have been recorded and released as concerts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scores like Terry Riley's "In C", which features specific lines of music that can be repeated any number of times in a set order by any number of and type of musician in performance. There is a specific feeling and certain themes that can be heard in all renditions, but no two performances feel quite the same. They are performed live and often released as albums. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Twitch plays...." like the modular synth setup on Twitch run by Perfect Circuit for a few weeks (?) last year&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative instruments like the Triadex Muse (I've written on this previously on the gemlog). It influenced Tom Whitwell of Music Thing Modular to create the first modular 'Turing machine' shift register, which has gone on to be an influential module for playing shifting music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative 'simulations' artwork like Ian Cheng's Emissaries, Theo Trian's work, or the commissions for MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology's Generative Unfoldings exhibition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eluvium's "Shuffle Drones" album. Made up of all tracks less than a minute in length and designed to be played in any order in that they will all drone together as you shuffle randomly through them &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shuffle Drones is a new Eluvium album that is anywhere between 13 minutes and 13,000 hours long, depending on how (and how long) you choose to play it. Consisting of 23 vignettes of orchestral ambience, it is designed to be played on shuffle. There is no end, and no beginning. Each song flows seamlessly into the next, regardless of the order in which they are played. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shuffle Drones is simultaneously intended for and in disruption of modern listening habits. In an era in which the way we listen can profoundly impact both what and how we listen, Shuffle Drones offers a unique and ever-changing path to listen.--Eluvium, 2017&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What other output shapes could there be for sharing these music systems?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some speculative ideas off the top of the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative radio stations, perhaps with shared controls to 'nudge them' or tweak them further&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More generative audiovisual works and simulations like the aforementioned Ian Cheng works and the like. Possibly featuring dialog, soundtrack, movements.  This area feels vastly underexplored to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative creation of new 'genres' - i don't know what this would look/sound like. Possibly like the work of generative.fm but rather than the user selecting the track-style there would be a random transition between playing different algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More interfaces to allow collaborative tweaking/creation of generative sound systems between experimental musicians. Imagine working live on a collaborative Pure Data or VCVRack working over the net.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generative analog hybrid instruments. Scores written algorithmically. Humans perform them or electroacoustic physical computing platforms are controlled by the score, played by things like the Gamelatron instrument. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video games where choices made by the player have a clear 1-to-1 influence over the generative systems creating the music such as instrument/sound selection, generated rhythms, tempo, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just the start, and I think there could be many other forms for presenting generative music. What other forms could this take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-09-28&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind rushing through your hair (I'm bald) on a warm day. The ability to literally turn 180 on the spot when you decide to change your route. The flow, moving in a fluid line from desire to destination. The ability to reject laws (stop signs, closed streets). Not being reliant on others nor contributing to ozone creation. A technology simple enough that the basics haven't changed much in 150 years, and it's clear enough to understand how it works by looking at it or riding it. Maintenance is minimal. You can do it yourself, or pay someone else and still feel like it's a huge bargain compared to car ownership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike's been my main mode of exercise and transportation for 20 years. It's useful for keeping weight and my blood sugar in check. It's the only consistent exercise I can do almost everyday. And when I don't feel like exercising I do it anyway just because I need to get somewhere fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite bikes are a touch less refined than the current 'gravel bikes' craze, which seems to revolve around newer custom built hybrid bikes. Believe me, you can use an 80s steel frame and get pretty much the same thing, unless you want disc brakes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/bianchi.gif" alt="My bianchi bike lakeside in Prospect Park, Brooklyn"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;My bianchi bike lakeside in Prospect Park, Brooklyn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I own 2 bikes that I've had for about 14 years. One is a Bianchi San Jose, a singlespeed/fixed with flip flop hub though I almost always ride singlespeed the past few years. The San Jose is essentially a clone of their Volpe touring bike but with rear-facing dropouts and a special 'flatbar' top bar so that you can haul the bike on your shoulder. If this bike were ever stolen I'd buy it again. I love it. Always true. I mean that literally; I have ridden it miles and miles on windy routes without needing to use my hands. I've ridden it with racks. Without. Currently I have a carradice bag with a bagman metal loop that it sits on to keep from grinding against the rear wheel. I'll be adding a front rack to the bike soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other bike is a Bridgestone MB-1 from I believe 89 or 90. The bike is slightly too small for me with its current setup. It's a light rigid fork and hardtail. I ride this on a hidden urban mountain bike trail near me regularly. Though sometimes I ride the Bianchi and just have to be careful of what I roll over. Recently I locked it up outside a cafe and an older gentleman asked me my price for selling it and when I named a number (high, since it's a classic and I'd need to buy another nice bike to replace it!) he told me he'd discuss with his wife. That's fine. I'm in no rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/bridgestone.gif" alt="My 30 year old Bridgestone MB-1 mountain bike"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riding a bike is so fundamental in my life that I'm surprised by how many others don't. I live in New York City where we clearly have public transit. And yet even before Covid the bike was one of my main modes of transit. To get 3 miles away from my apartment could take 45 minutes or more by subway, or just about 20 minutes by bike. Even for longer distances riding a bike is often the same amount of time as the subway when accounting for transfers. And where I live it appears that almost 1 in 5 people on the subway aren't wearing a mask, so on the bike I'm not worried about dealing with this nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should say that my "third bike" I occasionally ride is Citi Bike, the city's bike rental system. Most folks think it's a public department, but really these city bike programs are all run by commercial third parties, many which operate in multiple cities. In New York the company that owns the service is Motivate (Lyft), who also operates city bike programs in Portland, D.C., Chicago, Columbus, Boston/Cambridge, SF Bay, and Minneapolis/St. Paul. There are 40,000 bikes scattered around New York City, and I live just about 5 blocks beyond the furthest reach of one of the furthest docking stations in Brooklyn. Occasionally if I'm out and have taken the subway somewhere and want to get home I'll choose this method. This summer I was in Europe for a month and when I flew in I landed in Jersey, took a train to Manhattan and then rented Citi Bike to get home. It helps that I am a one-bag traveller and my backpack fit easily in the front basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridgestone bikes, the manufacturer of my mountain bike, were run by Grant Petersen, now the proprietor of Rivendell Bicycle Works as well as a writer. Grant's a self-professed 'retro-grouch.' He eschews the racer-like tendencies of bicycle manufacturers with their sleek delicate frames, missing practical parts to hold on racks or baskets, or using hard-to-maintain parts aimed at lycra-clad prosumers. He maintains that the best bike clothing and the best bike shoes are whatever you've got on. In addition to frames and completes Rivendell sells pine tar soap, tiny camp stoves and oldskool cork handgrips (I'm a fan). While the tiny production hand-made and painted frames are currently out of my financial ability, Rivendell's bikes provide a guide of what I think is important for enjoying cycling: bigger tires for rolling over potholes or roots, quality steel that can take some abuse, the ability to use racks or baskets for shopping, comfortable handlebars and pedals. This kind of bike could be built out of old 80s frames (Specialized Hardrock from that era for example). The difference between these old conversion bikes and a modern frame would be the quality of parts and level of handmade aesthetic detail, which is not important to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned to ride with neighborhood friends as a kid. We'd go out all day. As a college student I learned to mountain bike by getting a book on mountain biking from the local library. I read how to dodge rocks and do a bunny hop, skills I still use when I go out. Most of my friends are just street bikers but I love riding trails too, both for the nature, the solitude, the skill and challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When first riding, particularly as an adult, it's often in groups that a rider feels safest and can learn some of the subtle skills of urban riding. I used to ride with Midnight Ridazz in LA over a decade ago, as well as Critical Mass in Philly, and smaller groups when I lived in the desert. In these groups you find community, knowledge of how to work on your bike, support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention one of the big problems of biking: men. While I do know many women and non-binary riders the vast majority of folks I personally come across on a bike are white dudes, for a variety of complicated reasons. When riding in Denmark recently of course I noticed how normal it was for grandmothers and grandfathers, parents and children to all bike together. In the U.S. cycling has increased dramatically by immigrants and P.O.C, though much bicycle advocacy work leaves out these groups. The bike 'community' (as heterogenous as it is) needs to do more to support a diverse group of riders, and biking should be taught and supported in schools like swimming or driver's ed. Affordable bikes should be legislatively supported, and cities should support programs like Philadelphia's Neighborhood Bike Works, which provides kids with a bike and teaches them how to build up, ride and repair their bicycles. Most recently Citi Bike partnered with a health insurance company (who's branding appears on the program) to provide reduced fare $5 monthly Citi Bike memberships for Snap recipients and members of the New York City Housing Authority 16 years and older. Free would be a better price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where making art or music or coding is a *practice*, biking is for me a habit. It's not something I need to work on but something that just happens. A constant and reassuring presence in my life. I've been riding near-daily since entering college 20 years ago and I hope to ride til I can't anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Milk crate libraries, skateboarding and artist collectives &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-09-26&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to think about non-hierarchical organizing models. Anarchism in particular is often incorrectly challenged as an ideal without working models. This is largely done not out of malice but a failure of imagination or ability to look for alternatives to one's own locus of knowledge. This isn't intended to be a broad essay on the political system of anarchist organizing writ large or an overview of the numerous working models of anarchist societies. There are many of these elsewehere. I particularly recommend Chomsky's On Anarchism and James Scott's Two Cheers for Anarchism as beginner-friendly sources in general as well as reading about the current territories of Rojava and Chiapas. Rather, this is a tiny post on three rhizomatic organizing systems in my own life that are anarchist in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/rhizome.gif" alt="An antique spurge plant, Euphorbia antiquorum, sending out rhizomes, by Frank Vincentz CC BY-SA 3.0"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;An antique spurge plant, Euphorbia antiquorum, sending out rhizomes, by Frank Vincentz CC BY-SA 3.0&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rhizome: A plant stem that grows horizontally under or along the ground and sends out roots below and shoots above in a reproductive system with new plants developing from the (off)shoots.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Milk crate libraries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 15 years I've moved at least 8 times to different apartments or houses, not counting the times travelling for extended periods. I'm not proud of this fact but it's a reflection of precarity, job opportunity, and rising rents in expensive cities. The only possessions I've had consistently throughout this entire time are my books, a constantly evolving collection. For this entire time, my books have been housed in milk crates, both the scavenged and stolen kind, the imitation Ikea/Container Store variety, and now I also own 4 'designer' milk crates with marbling patterning that I bought on the internet (not proud of this, but it was during peak Covid and I excused myself this extravagance.). When moving from California to the east coast I packed my milk crates into my van, drove up the coast, dropped off a few dozen books for resale at a public library sale fundraiser. The rest were packed into my cousin's garage in northern california and some were shipped to my parent's place, and I sold my van and used the money to buy my flight tickets to begin my extended round the world travel. After travelling I collected these crates and the entire collection came together again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/milkcrates.gif" alt="Milkcrates library"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Milkcrates library&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now as a fulltime employed worker I can afford a more 'fine' designer book shelving, but I love my milkcrates. The milk crates are an ideal rhizomatic modular library. Currently I have 7 milkcrates in my apartment and maybe 20 or so in my office. What i love about this method is its useable, expandable nature. New parts (shelving) can be added easily. The sum is made up of the separate parts, and you can easly see these parts, yet the sum feels like a complete whole as well. If needed, at the end of semester, or after moving, the parts can be separated, easily moved, reassembled or dissembled back into separate collections. When moving apartments, the crates themselves are the packing material. Over time as I want to change organizing methods or rearrange my interior I can easily do so. A box of zines can be easily brought to a picnic, infoshop, class or merch table. And the disparate colors (garbled green, white, black, gray) combine in aesthetically pleasing palettes no matter the combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Skateboarding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been biking my entire life, but I'm mostly an amateur and late-in-life skateboarder. I'd hardly call myself a 'good' skater but I can skate enough to get around, and I like doing it. An associate of the Universal Research Group Brandon Avery Joyce cites skateboarding as an ideal organizing model. One skateboards alone, or meets up with friends to form a temporary group, breaking down into sub-groups when heading off to different neigborhoods to get home for example. 'Meetings' happen in alleyways, behind shipping warehouses, parking lots and the like. Alignments are constantly remade. Skate styles and communities are multi-varied. Despite successful attempts at co-optation (Nike, the Olympics) it still exists largely unsanctioned and in the fringe of most comumnities, literally on the edge and excess of capitalism. To get started requires about $20 - 70. Skateboarding literally re-imagines our city streets, re-making the architecture to our own fantasies and needs. There is no institution or big skateboarding. We melt back into society, grinding concrete back into the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Artist collectives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've written previously about my experiences being part of various art collectives. These are pre-figurative groups and spaces, creating and living the model of the world that we want to see exist beyond our own community. Largely enacted in small intentional communities, these groups feel to me like they are dealing within a small community with the larger issues that I want to reckon with in my life: what makes a meaningful life? how do I want to relate to and join with other people? what can we do together? when do I need to go my own way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of activity can often feel like it revolves around lots of meetings: planning, check-ins. There's little or no money to be made in many of these activities, and so the work grows out of our inner core emotions. Things can get hairy in a way that many people only ever experience (I think) that deeply with other family members. But for many of us, these communities are founded and created intentional communities specifically to find common support and meaning. With rotating leadership in a few examples or leaderless decision-making it's one of the few more formally-organized group that feels like an appropriate group organizing model. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in warehouses, basements, apartments, these places come and go. New people come in and out. Extended families grow. They are sites for exhibits, concerts, meals, creation, distribution of materials and food and zines. The rise of the internet has affected how these groups organize, but perhaps much less than you might think. And it hasn't supplanted or eliminated the need for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-09-23&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up a tilde server for a small group of Linux beginners &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester I'm teaching a computer science class called "Social Software." Some of the topics we are studying include open source software, version control, collaboration project teamwork, working with servers, a history of social software, early networking, Linux, and experimental and esoteric social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few weeks we looked at predecessors to social media and social software from the pre-internet era such as telegraphs, radio call-in shows, personals ads and the like. We moved into looking at early networking such as Community Memory, the proto-message board set up in Berkeley in the 70s, and about timesharing, the era when large mainframe computers would have maybe dozens of connections from remote 'dumb terminals' where people would log in to run programs on the shared computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also talked about the finger protocol and I demonstrated ssh, finger, and moving around and working with a Linux system. Then I introduced the idea of a tilde server and we talked about what that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I let students request a login username, then gave them a complex password, and showed them how to login via ssh on the classroom computers (Macs) or via Git-Bash on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Creating the server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for a free server such as the Google Cloud Compute, but I couldn't find a free tier price that allowed 20 users (unless I'm mistaken). Alternatively, I could and probably should have set up a server on a Pi or other old computer. Instead, I signed up to create the cheapest instance I could find, which looked to be $2.50 monthly on vultr.com, cheaper than Digital Ocean for example. They have you add money to your account, which I believe was $10 minimum, so I added this amount, selected their cheapest plan, and created a "cloud compute" instance. I want to point out that with the estimated usage amount I have, my plan will actually work out to about $6 a month. I don't know why it's higher but caveat emptor. I've filed a ticket to request an explanation and will update this once I get a useful response.&lt;/p&gt;

(update 2021-09-27: Vultr responded that only their Atlanta data center allows for $2.50 monthly service, and that often it is 'sold out.' This information is not stated on the signup page, nor even on any FAQ page. The customer service response was fairly rude (my email wasn't), and I will probably not use Vultr again).

&lt;p&gt;When you create the server there are lots of OS choices, including Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, and many other choices. You can also choose the server location. I chose Ubuntu 20.04 since I have a lot of experience with that and wanted things to work quickly and be able to debug myself without having to do much searching when setting up for my class. I selected a New Jersey data center, the closest to my own school's location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logging in as root and setting up &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 10 minutes the server had been initialized and I had a generated complex root password. Vultr has a web-based virtual 'console' I used, which fired up a Terminal shell and had a prompt for me to enter my root password, which I entered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the standard update procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to edit text files with Neovim, so I installed it with sudo apt install nvim. For my students they should definitely learn nano instead, so I installed sudo apt install nano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think you should learn to drive manual before driving automatic. Some think you should learn music theory before doing improv. Some think you should learn Bash before trying a shell with completion like Fish. I certainly do not think that. In fact, I think fish shell is a great way to quickly pull in Linux newbies who could get stymied by a shell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt install fish
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I installed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt install bsdgames fail2ban finger cowsay figlet python ansiweather w3m sl
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all of these, fail2ban is essential (to prevent hacker/bot attacks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up timezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, we're in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Security: Setup fail2ban and remove root login&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used rlafuente's started jail.local file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt install fail2ban
wget https://tilde.pt/~rlafuente/files/jail.local
sudo mv jail.local /etc/fail2ban
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cd'ed to the fail2ban folder and edited the jail.local file. I commented out the apache stuff since I'm not running an apache/web-server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
fail2ban-server --test
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all works okay, launch it now and it will launch each time server starts up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also turned off the ability for root to login remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config you should find the line PermitRootLogin and change it to no (or add this line if it didn't exist). Save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always check attempted connections to your server via &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep Failed
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting a Message of the Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I edited the /etc/motd/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

echo "Who is logged in?\n"

users | tr ' ' \\n | uniq

Hello and welcome to anti-soft.

This is a single computer ("in the cloud") that we are all sharing together. 
This is a fun Linux server for exploration and learning. There are lots of resources online for learning about Linux. 

TIP: If you get stuck, you can cancel out of many commands with Control-C or force quit/exit is Control-D.

To log out of anti-soft, type exit at the prompt.

Run "getting-started" for a list of software and commands to try.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding custom starter functions for all&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added two custom functions for all users on the system. Fish functions (the equivalent of Bash aliases) need to be installed inside /etc/fish/functions for all users to be able to access them by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;getting-started is a cheatsheet of beginner linux commands and specially installed software on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;getting-started.fish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
function getting-started 
    echo "cd  to jump to a directory or cd .. to go back (and cd by itself to go home)
    ls to list files in current directory
    pwd to display current directory (aka folder) name
    cat  prints out a file
    touch  creates a new file
    nano  edits a file
    man &lt;command&gt; displays the manual for a command. arrows to scroll. q to quit.
    mkdir  creates a folder (directory)
    rm  deletes a file permanently (careful!)

    Read any Linux resource for more info on basic linux commands.

    Special for our server:
    who  - lists everyone currently logged in
    wall \"my message\" - broadcasts your message (and Control-L to clear screen of messages)
    write  - starts a direct live message
    cowsay "my message" - for important announcements
    sl - When you type ls backwards
    figlet - for creating banner images
    weather - fetch a 5 day weather forecast for Purchase, in fahrenheight
    w3m  - web browser
    python - the programming language
    finger  - displays info on a user
    fish - our shell (already running)

    We also have many games installed: adventure, arithmetic, atc, backgammon, battlestar, bcd, boggle, caesar, canfield, countmail, cribbage, dab, go-fish, gomoku, hack, hangman, hunt, mille, monop, morse, number, pig, phantasia, pom, ppt, primes, quiz, random, rain, robots, rot13, sail, snake, tetris-bsd, trek, wargames, worm, worms, wump, wtf 
    "
end
&lt;/command&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;weather.fish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
function weather
  ansiweather -l "Purchase, NY" -u imperial -s true -f 5 -d true
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Turn on ssh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turns on ssh as well as the firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could make changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config as well to configure security and connection settings such as if you require folks to login with a public-private key pair instead of a password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Add users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user gets created they will have a folder on the server. I want each person to have a hello.txt file ready and waiting for them. So I added the skeleton file inside /etc/skel/. Files in this directory will be copied to a home directory each time a user is created.&lt;/p&gt;

/etc/skel/hello.txt

&lt;pre&gt;
Hello and welcome to anti-soft tilde server

Programs to try out:

cowsay
figlet
and many more. 
Message your admin ~lettuce with requests for other software.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my students were asked for their preferred username. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I created new accounts for each of them, along with a complex password. I added them &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
adduser 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When prompted I created a hard password and wrote it down and handed the password to my students. They are free to change it themselves later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted students to have fish shell by default. Since I installed it already on the server, I just had to change their default shell. This probably should be automated, but I only have 20 students so typed up and changed their name and then hit enter, 20 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
chsh --shell /usr/bin/fish 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make yourself an admin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still logged in as root? Let's make a new account and make it an admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create yourself as a user as above. Then in addition change your permissions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
adduser 
chsh --shell /usr/bin/fish 
sudo usermod -a -G sudo 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will add you to the sudoers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to exit from the web console and try ssh'ing in as your new admin username if you haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Activity: Finger someone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finger was one of the THE original computer-based 'social media.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view info on someone, finger &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or to view a remote user: finger jroig@finger.farm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set up your own finger profile and plans and project: chfn (aka, change finger)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then create plaintext files at either or both ~/.plan ~/.project. They will be added to your profile when someone fingers you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chat locally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See who is logged in with the who command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post a message for everyone to see who is logged in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
wall "my message"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will be interrupted and can clear it with Control-L or Control-C to escape out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start a dialog with one other user logged in,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
write username
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereafter you can just type and hit enter and messages will be delivered between you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;And explore further&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could add html and gemini hosting and many other pieces of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional custom software can be added to /usr/local/bin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encouraged my students to test out all of the bsdgames, create and edit files, leave messages for each other, and just generally mess around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I did not add apache because I did not run a web server (students already have free webspace on campus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck. Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in hearing about how well your students take to using the tilde server! E.g., how much use outside of class it sees, whether they use the server at all after the course is over (if the server is to remain up), how engaged they seem. Sounds to me like a fun class! --lykso&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yeah ill be curious too! ð --lettuce&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ctrl-c.club/~lettuce/computer-systems-social-networks.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>gemini-love.html</title><link>https://ctrl-c.club/~lettuce/gemini-love.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;What I Still Like About Gemini (and what I don't)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-09-20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been visiting Gemini for about a year, and hosting this gemlog for 10 months so far. I still like it, and still spend about 30 minutes (sometimes more, sometimes less) reading Gemini pages a few times a week. I read on Elaho on my phone or tablet before bed, in Amfora on my laptop, on Amfora when ssh'ing to Ctrl-C Club tilde or occasionally AV-98 when on an obscure or underpowered old computing device (10 year old raspberry pi B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the parts I enjoy, and those that I don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini is mostly text, with or without my own CSS-like overlay. I read on my phone in Elaho or in the command line with Amfora. It is blazing fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No commercial use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalism eventually co-opts almost everything but as of yet there are no commercial entities, ads, monetization or products as far as I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Slow content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini rewards creating and reading longer blog-like articles. The main form of most sites is an index with a listing of posts as links. From here I can easily pick what to read or ignore. The small size of the Gemini-verse means there is less that I feel I need to be constantly up to date with. Rather than check it one or more times a day I can connect occasionally every few days and still feel like I'm not missing things I'm interested in. Conversations of sorts on various topics ripple through slowly. And some folks (like myself) allow commenting by those who email their response to a post. All of this is very -slow- compared to consuming web media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a digital flaneur of sorts I am able to randomly traipse from one gemlog to another through visiting links. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also can use simple feed-like methods (built-in to various clients or through other software) to stay up to date with gemlogs that I subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Variety of client options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity and robustness of the spec allows for a variety of clients in many languages and configurations to exist. It also means that it's pretty easy to find one that works on quite old hardware, or can even be made to work. This comes as a result of the original goal of being able to create a client can be written in any language in less than about 100 lines of code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Parts I Don't Love&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TLS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement for security is not useful for me. The times that I get errors on various clients are always a result of certificate errors or changes. It also makes a higher barrier to entry that seems uneccessary. I think without this there would be more people serving their own gemlogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Oppen (creator of Ariane Android Gemini client) pointed out the (fantasy) Mercury protocol specified by Solderpunk, founder of the Gemini protocol spec. It strips the ideas of Gemini back even further so that there are only two different kinds of lines of text: a) text or b) links. He's creating his own Mercury client. At this point I've made my peace to stick with Gemini but I'd very interested in Mercury as an alternative protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Limited Non-programming Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though mostly simple, as a result of TLS requirements or due to the community growing largely out of Mastodon and other similar tech-ajacent spaces, Gemini is dominated by programmer-y gemlogs. I am guilty of this myself, and I enjoy reading these, but I'd like much more content options as well. More gemlogs by musicians, artists, jugglers, quilters, teachers, cooks, parents, carpenters, cyclists, storytellers, et. cetera. Less about our own dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as the platform gets popular, mainstream, and you get gemlogs by non-tech people, youâll start to see more companies take notice and try to monetize it.--Rex&lt;/blockquote&gt;

--- 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oh no, I hope that doesn't happen. You may be right.--lettuce&lt;/blockquote&gt;

---

&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel it wont become filled with ads and the such like the regular web and will remain as is.--jamesjacksonjr.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

---

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that gemini is designed in a way that will make monetization somewhat difficult even if we don't consider the social aspects of it. Ads are prevalent on the web due to javascript. If I want to get paid for a website i just put some javascript on it that will load any ad an advertiser feels like. I'm sure eventually people will have some sort of ad copy in the middle of their content. Like how podcasts have sponsors where they stop talking about what you actually came to listen to and tell you how good hello-fresh is but it will never be as bad as the www.--b0b@bulletpr00f.host&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ctrl-c.club/~lettuce/gemini-love.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>flow-and-time.html</title><link>https://ctrl-c.club/~lettuce/flow-and-time.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;On Flow and 'Putting in the Time'&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-09-12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OR Cultivating a Creative Practice Part II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;subjects: flow, being an amateur, 'putting in the time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously wrote about cultivating a creative practice. I wrote about how it's an essential activity as a human. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="creative-practice.html"&gt;Cultivating a Creative Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to expand on that post with some additional ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate warm and gooey feeling that one can achieve in the act of creative expression is the feeling of 'flow.' This zen-like state is when time drops away, the mind disappears and your whole being is absorbed in creation. You are singing or moving or sculpting and you forget yourself. You turn out the work almost as if you were divinely led. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flow can be very relaxing or it can be intense concentration. The outcome of your work may be a beautiful work of art. Or it could be just a momentary period of unrestricted improvisational creation. It can happen solo, and it can happen beautifully in a collaboration like a jam session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we fail to hit flow in our creative practice many people have a tendency to become self-critical. Or worse: they quit. The problem is that they may have quit too soon. In a society that rewards virtuousic mastery (as well as vapid 'fame') it's important not to force ourselves to only do activities that we can be 'masters' of or professionalize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you do want to become 'great' at an activity then you have to 'put in the time' and sometimes that can take months or years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there's two parts to keep in mind. First, enjoy being an amateur. There can be a real joy in having the freedom to make mistakes. Beginners often stumble across techniques and optimistic mindsets in ways that those with lots of experience can only dream of experiencing again. In our quest to become experts it's easy to resent one's lack of experience and to want to jump to being an expert, but if we do that we are forgetting these opportunities for exploration and discovering with fresh eyes, ears and minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it's normal to be bad at something, often for a long time. Ira Glass of the podcast This American Life speaks about how he sucked as a host, for years and years and years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first couple years that you're making stuff what you're making is not so good. It's not great. It's trying to be good. It has ambition to be good but it's not that quite that good. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, your taste is still killer. And your taste can tell you that what you're making is a disappointment to you. You can kind of tell. A lot of people never get past that phase, and a lot of people at that point, they quit. And the thing I would just like to say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste and they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. It didn't have this special thing they wanted it to have. Everybody goes through that. And for you to go through that right now or if you're just getting out of that phase you've got to know is that it's totally normal. And the most important thing you can do is to do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story. Because it's only by going through a volume of work that you are actually going to catch up and close that gap. And your work you're making will be as good as your ambitions....It's normal to take a while and you're just going to have to fight your way through that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Okay. So this contradicts some of what I earlier wrote about being an amateur, allowing yourself hobbies or pure joy of creation. I'm okay with having these simultaneous thoughts that may compete with one another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing creative work often means just putting in dedicated time. Doing a little each day or when you can. Not letting other things get in your way. If you want to get great, whatever that means to you, just putting in the time is important. What Malcolm Gladwell calls the '10,000 hours' to become an expert (that number has been disputed by the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year I usually participate in a month-long creation project. For example in October is Inktober. November is National Novel Writing Month (or NaNoGenMo, the National Novel Generating Month). I've done looptober, where I played and recorded an improvised new track every day on my modular synth, which rapidly taught me how to play my synth and to understand control voltage way better. Other months I've worked on a game every day, or committed to doing daily code sketches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other motivators to help dedicate regular time to work on my practice includes having deadlines. Setting internal deadlines doesn't usually work for me. I can ignore. But having open studios that I announce means I need to have something ready to show when people show up. Applying for and getting into exhibits means I have to make the work to show it or attempt to have it shown. Setting up a date/time to do a zoom or in-person studio visit means I'll need to have work ready to show at that time. These are all ways to motivate and encourage spending time on my creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It Is okay to quit. If during this time you decide you aren't interested in the practice anymore, or want to shift to something else, or if you really want to enjoy it as an amateur, that's OK. But make sure you don't decide on this too soon! Put some intention into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I've found is that over time I've been able to build control and my craft but I also am able to retain some of my 'amateurism' too. I've been able to unlearn the proper way to.....draw, program, play my instrument, even teach. I put in time. I cultivate my practice. I find collaborators. And I have some deadlines (and good things like open studios, concerts, exhibits and talks) at low stakes and sometimes 'bigger' venues along the way. I think this is what's allowed me to have an expanded creative practice and success organizing in artist and experimental communities for over a decade and not be burnt out but in fact still excited and motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-28&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to have a creative practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means putting a little time, perhaps every day or perhaps once a week into making things. This could be art or photos or flower arrangements. It means allowing yourself time and space to explore, be that: writing TTRPG campaigns, creating pottery, woodworking, weaving, drawing, making personal software projects or playing the banjo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I casually threw 'making personal software projects' above. I really do believe this is a creative practice, or that it can be. I have a personal practice of creating mostly web-based digital code sketches. These are small coding projects that result in visual art, mostly generative art, sometimes games, or experimental works that live on a corner of my website and on github. I have a past partner who is a painter. She would always do colored pencil sketches before moving to paint on large canvases. I do the the coding equivalent: just trying out some small code thing that might be good or bad or who knows. It could become something big, or not. I've been doing this for about 2 years and have created about 200 small web-based projects of this type. Sometimes I spend 30 minutes. Other times 2 hours. Occasionally I spend 8 or 20 hours and they go on to become much bigger projects. Working small and open-ended produces positive feelings. It's a pleasure. It's my 'practice.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that for those of us that make software it's important to also work with your hands on something away from the computer. You don't have to become an expert. It's okay to have hobbies and to try many things. But it's important to garden or work on your bike or take walks or build crossword puzzles or juggle. I'd also suggest that having a hobby that makes a mess is important. Cooking could be this area for you. Or painting. Or tie dying clothes. Or doing collaged zines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your creative practice doesn't need to be for anyone else. It could be for you. It maybe should be mostly for you. It's okay to be more self-focused. It's a way to relax and tap into flow. Taking photographs or screenshots or finding some way to document informally as you go can really feel great when you look back in a year or several years later. You won't regret having documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your creative practice can be shared with others too. In fact meeting up with friends that share your interests is really nice, and a way to learn and grow. Recently I sat with a friend, plugged our computers into the same mixer, and made heavy doom ambient music together, each of us plugged into each others' pedals and feeding back our output into the same input in a loop. We created wailing beautiful longform ambient compositions, pieces that never existed before and will never exist again. We could mess up, and we could create beautiful messes of sound. Sometimes our sound layered in ways that were sublime elegiac walls of drones. Jamming together feels good. It's healing. If you don't have any friends locally sharing your interests, look for places where people gather. During the pandemic there are a million online forums and chat groups dedicated to many creative pursuits. It can be nice to join one of these, though investing too much time online takes away from your artmaking too. There's a balance to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making time for your creative practice can be difficult. It's the last thing many people feel they have time for. There are chores and homework and job tasks and kids to take care of and food to prepare and deadlines always deadlines. But a creative practice is essential to life too. And it needs to be supported by giving yourself time. Having a studio can be helpful if you need it, or even just a corner of a desk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving your tools out really helps to get started. I have my modular synth and recording device set up all the time, on half of my desk. The other half of my desk is my work computer. I can just push down the lid and immediately slide my chair over, turn on the speaker and synth and recorder with a switch and just start making music. I almost always leave my previous patches plugged in so I have a way to jump in immediately without having to do prep, since prep gives an excuse to postpone creative time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing to say is that one's creative practice doesn't need to be toward a particular end or goal. The practice in and of itself is the goal. The journey is the destination. Most modern societies have made it difficult to pursue creative acts, or educated us that if we aren't masterful virtuosic creators then we shouldn't be creating. But that kind of thinking is flat wrong. We create because we're humans and because it makes us happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have repetitive stress injury (RSI) in my right arm, exacerbated from multiple breaks in my right elbow and shoulder from skateboarding and mountain biking accidents sustained about 15 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also addicted to my computers and on them all the time. This is a bad combo. When I type too much on a laptop (think 8 hour days) I can easily get throbbing, progressive pain in my wrist, elbow and shoulder along my rotator cuff. Even right now at the end of a long day as I'm typing this before bed I have a little bit of pain in my elbow but I've gotten used to it and don't even notice it as much anymore. But now I'm stretching it out and trying to massage it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the same time I got into my bad bike accident and recovered I decided to learn to type on a Dvorak keyboard. Dvorak, as seen in the illustration at the top, places the most common consonant and vowels in the center row with vowels on the left side. The layout dates to 1936, about 60 years after QWERTY's invention. The claim is that typing in Dvorak is faster, more efficient, better on your body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child I'd watch the gameshow Wheel of Fortune with my grandmother on Friday nights. On the show contestants would attempt to guess the letters making up a hidden word or phrase. It's like a gameshow version of the text or computer game Hangman. In the final round of the show they would start the contestant with 'the most common letters,' which even 25 years later I can remember easily that they listed R, S, T, L, N, E. In QWERTY these 'most common' letters are not placed in the most convenient locations but all over the keyboard. Okay, so I buy the first idea, that the Dvorak layout is more 'efficient.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd read claims that Dvorak also reduced repetitive stress injury. As someone experiencing RSI, that was enough to convince me to try something new. I want to say quickly two things: A) I didn't take too long to 'learn' the new layout and thought it was relatively easy, but B) I'm the kind of person that enjoys learning and trying new things out so wasn't put off by the first few times that felt downright impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Learning Dvorak&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so here is how I learned: I timed my start of learning Dvorak with the start of a vacation break so I didn't have major coding / writing to do, and this way I could make sure to ONLY type in Dvorak the whole time and not jump back and forth between QWERTY and Dvorak, which I heard would make it really difficult to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. So the first thing I did was change my computer to Dvorak. Just an internet search or two will tell you how to do this. Then I used typing software like the Mario Teaches Typing kinda game. I used a different one but it's been almost 15 years and I don't remember which one. Shouldn't really matter. Actually, I see it's on the Internet Archive. Okay, I'm pausing writing right now so I can try the game out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Mario_Teaches_Typing_1992"&gt;Mario Teaches Typing on the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay I'm back. That game is awesome! I really recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. I took a month off from work between jobs and decided to go on a long multi-state bike trip without a computer. During this time I would bike into a small town and arrive in the library and want to check my email. I visited a website that would automatically convert qwerty to dvorak if I didn't have system access to change the actual machine, and then I'd copy and paste that into my emails. Because I was on vacation and had an auto-responder on, people knew I was away and might not respond, and they also seemed to accept my short emails. They didn't know that it took me forever to write these 1 or 2 sentence emails. I continued to spend time each day practicing Dvorak. I don't know how long it took, but maybe a week or so for me to be comfortable enough and fast enough to feel ok and probably a couple weeks to get back to my full speed. Later I surpassed my initial typing speed. Again I want to emphasize that I did NOT switch back to QWERTY because I heard that would totally confuse me. The few times I did try it sure as hell did. So I basically didn't switch back and forth and stayed in Dvorak except for my phone. Since I don't touch type on my phone I didn't see a need to switch to Dvorak there and I don't think it was possible at the time. Now that I type this I'm thinking maybe I should check to see if it is and switch. Even though it's been almost 15 years, seems like a good idea to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Disadvantages of Dvorak&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even to this day I really hate switching to QWERTY, though I can do it if I reallllly have to. The truth is that when I worked with students in the classroom pre-Covid it could be a pain to mentally switch if I was on their machine typing code. Though I know how to switch layout on their machines, I rarely do because I'm worried it'll confuse or creep them out for me to go into their settings and change their keyboard. This is the main drawback of Dvorak. You're a left-hander in a right-hander's world (bad metaphor, sorry). The other thing is that there really isn't widespread evidence with large scientific testing if Dvorak really is that much better for you than QWERTY. Anecdotally many of us think it is, and many of us think we type a lot faster now but there haven't been many (any?) studies as far as I know. That said, I think typing in Dvorak is fun. I barely remember the learning process since it was almost 15 years ago and relatively fast. And it's basically second nature and I don't think about it anymore. But I think even more effective than Dvorak is....a different keyboard AND avoiding using the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keyboard-driven computer use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many hackers love keyboard-less computing. Not only is it slower, less efficient, using a computer mouse irritates my RSI way more than anything else. For this reason, I use Neovim, the modal text editor but also Vim 'keybindings' for the Terminal (in Fish shell) and use the i3 window manager. i3 was a pain to set up because it assumes QWERTY. At some point I'll put my i3 for Dvorak users tutorial up. A quick tip is to switch to QWERTY, log out and boot into i3, run the install wizard, then switch back to Dvorak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim: Works fine in Dvorak, even navigation. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the j and k (down and up respectively) and h and l (left and right) keys are next to each other and feel natural to type. The ONLY disadvantage I've found is that for oldskool roguelike games with 8-direction keys I don't have the 4 corner keys to rely on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keyboards and RSI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so if you have RSI or are worried about possibly getting it in the future from typing too much, what else can you do? Rather than or in addition to Dvorak it seems like maybe the most important factors are ergonomics. I'm going to leave out your chair and desk and concentrate on the keyboard. Though the chair and desk are important, I'm not the kind of person to sit at one all day. I move from bed to couch to desk to floor to coffeeshop to porch to type, on many chairs or non-chairs, and I think moving around is helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a switch to a split mechanical keyboard about 5 years ago. Prior to that time I used the laptop's keyboard. Now I use mainly my Kinesis Advantage Pro keyboard, an older model from Kinesis that I bought used for $150. I absolutely love it. I have it set up on my desk, though there have been times in my life that I would commute with it to an office (it's big and takes up a backpack) because I loved it so much. I don't love it because of its wacky aesthetic. In fact, it looks like a cross between a dashboard and medical office keyboard. It's about as cool as a recumbent bicycle. But I've found that using that keyboard with its separated split-in-half keyboard with 'bowl-shaped' keyboard keys has made a huge difference. Additionally I use Cherry MX Brown keys, which came with the board. I love it so much that I have considered for a long time buying a second, but at $270 refurbished/$350 new I haven't taken the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For purchasing new the New York Times Wirecutter recommends the Kinesis Freestyle RGB, which is about $200-220, or less without the RGB lights or purchased refurbished. They recommend that over the Advantage because it allows for more movement/tweaking to get the placement and angles exactly right. I haven't done it beacuse I really like the way the Kinesis style uses thumb keys. It's very comfortable to me and I wouldn't want to lose them. There's also the Moonlander keyboard in a similar style but twice the price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're the DIY type there are plans for smaller split keyboards, though many don't have the tenting of a Kinesis that RSI sufferers seem to like which allows you to tilt your hands at a more natural angle. I purchased a complete Atreus keyboard. It's a small keyboard with a case, split but not tented (remember tenting means angled out more naturally for the hands). It's so small that it doesn't have separate number keys so one of the keys is used as a 'layer' key, which is like a super-shift but now your letters become numbers, function keys and special symbols. Like learning Dvorak I didn't find it hard to learn. Since I got the keyboard a year ago I know for sure that it took me about a week and a half of occasional use to get used to the layout. It would have been way faster if I used it full time. I also have a third keyboard, the relatively cheap Keychron C1 that I bought on sale for $50 and that I leave in my office, which I use a few hours a day 2 or 3 days a week. It's not a split keyboard but like my other keyboards I set it up Dvorak. By the way, changing a mechanical keyboard to Dvorak is easy. You can use a special puller device to pull off the keycap and then you hand press it down where it's supposed to be moved to and it clicks in. The Atreus has special software called Chrysalis that can be used on Mac, PC, Linux to change the firmware's layout. I set it up so that the Atreus outputs QWERTY even though I'm typing Dvorak on the keyboard. This lets me plug the keyboard into my students' computers or classroom computers and not have to manually switch to Dvorak since the keyboard will push out the right letters. And though I'm a touch typer I do like seeing the keys occasionally when I'm navigating music or games so on one of my laptops I purchased stickers and put them down on top of the QWERTY letters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a vertical mouse but I've heard they're really helpful for RSI. Get one. I'll get one too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last thought is really important: if you actually have RSI and a flare-up: stop typing and take a break. Stop for the day or weekend. I sometimes have to do this because ofthe pain if I am mobile with just my laptop and without my Kinesis to type on. But even without this magic keyboard it's important to not be on the computer all the time. If there is pain, we're doing something wrong. And that much typing / computer use is not good for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Keyboards I use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinesis Advantage Pro (now retired. Latest is Kinesis Advantage 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keyboard.io Atreus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keychron C1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm on the Atreus also. I use Dvorak but for the Atreus I've moved the lower row of letters over one step to the right so that I can have the X on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of keyboard, though, my completely unscientific RSI placebo cure (I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice) is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrists, the part of the arm down close to the hands, cannot be touching anything while typing. They should not be "resting" on something. Instead, I alternate between typing in one of two ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Having the arms just sorta hanging in the air, keeping them up by my own willpower and/or resting the fingers themselves on the keys themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Pushing the keyboard up deeper onto the desk so that my arms can get support up closer to the elbows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for sharing your experience. Love your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aka How I use Git wrong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CW: Highly opinionated thoughts ahead, as well as confessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How I Use Version Control Solo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a simple (and glorified) log of my individual software projects as I work on them over time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Packaging up my individual websites &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding a single software project and creating a little workflow to add and test new features and jump to different versions (occasionally)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going back to previous 'commits' when i've lost or messed something up (rarely)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I am often using Git just as a service for logging (via the commit messages) and saving (via committing) and backing up to a remove Git server. These are not the main feature or raison d'etre for Git, which is complex version control software with way more features and possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What else I use a software forge for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;backing up and/or hosting a website (for example on GitHub, GitLab) or deploying to a server via a Git hook (any)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding my gemlog, then using a hook to upload to my gemini server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooperating on a collaborative software project with many other people (issues, pull requests, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a place to browse and find others' software projects as inspiration or to learn from or to use for my own needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Opinions on various version control software forges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have experience with Git-based version control software, though I'm sure I'd like others as well, especially if they had a more streamline workflow for solo devs. I've heard there are other nice systems but I'm comfortable with Git so that's where I'll probably stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very easy to jump between any Git-based version control server. The commands are all the same. I personally use GitHub (for public projects that I need to deploy a website), Keybase Git (for personal encryped git stuff. my own personal vimwiki is on here) and Tildegit (smol-web projects). I've checked out some others as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the big one, the place for your software to be seen. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aside: Recently Github phased out passwords and requires 'tokens' now. I set up a long, unlimited-time token, so it's basically just a long password. Couldn't find info online on how to remove my old password and use the token instead. The solution was to basically remove old password from the ~/.gitconfig file and put in the token as my new password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Con: Works with ICE and other distasteful companies and gov. Is a Startup. Uses Gamification (favoriting/stars, counting forks...). Requires pro account for unlimited private repos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro: GitHub pages for website hosting of static sites free &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, GitHub was my go-to service for years but I wanted to find an alternative when I learned about their work with ICE. I doubt my (free) non-enterprise account is more than a drop in the bucket, but it feels right to try to move away from the service. Now I make all of my new projects repos with another service. I still maintain some repos here for past projects. And I use regular Github when I do pull requests or file issues on other software projects.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Keybase Git&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of Keybase, a secure encryped private file system, message system, Git system. But they are a startup and were bought by Zoom (poor surveillace record when it comes to issues relating to China), so now many people don't trust them. They also added a ton of unneccessary features, including........cryptocurrency. Meaning they are trying to figure out how to monetize for 10X returns. Not what I'm looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it as a backup for my own wiki, and as a glorified encrypted virtual hard drive for my PDF reading library. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Con: Is a startup. Too many features. No web frontend for their Git service. Like Steam, requires a service running (though there is a way to do this via CLI). Owners Zoom is not a great company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro: Free. The Git server service is a simple and encrypted by default service. I've not hit a bandwidth or size limit. Has a way to host files/static site, but not documented how to use a built-in hook, so requires accessing via GUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tildegit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exclusive git service server since you need to be a member of a Tilde server to sign up. "Just works". I like browsing the explore page to see other smol-internet projects. Very easy web UI. I think it's nice and simple compared to the GitHub website: no gamification or random riffraff buy-now and enterprise services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Con: I've been using it a year and one time (yesterday!) it went down for 4 or 5 hours, which was deeply confusing and troubled me. Reminds me that I should have an additional backup of my crucial repos, so that I have 3 total copies. Signup requires proof of tilde membership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro: Great for solo devs. It's a Gitea-based system, so there's documentation of Gitea online (though I haven't needed to use it since it's intuitive and 99% compatible with other Git-based workflows like GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sourcehut&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite of many smol-web users, and now provides free hosting of gemlogs. The founder has his own gemlog. However, I won't use Sourcehut. In my opinion the founder is a bully. I noticed this on Mastodon before he deleted his account. And I see it elsewhere. Feel free to read one example of this yourself and make up your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/issues/199"&gt;Example of bullying makeworld, creator of the Amfora gemini client.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CON: The proprietor is a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRO: Simple. Lightweight. Free gemlog hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Codeberg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven't used this one. I looked for a code of conduct (to see if they would accept business from defense contractors and police departments for example) and I didn't find one. I asked on twitter and didn't get much response. Seems like some amount of community by smol-web users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CON: I don't know. I haven't used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRO: I don't know. I haven't used it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GitLab&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't used it. It's the 'alternative' to the big dog GitHub. Provides lots of enterprise options, as wll as static site hosting, and other big version control services. While they didn't have a contract with ICE their executive director distastefully said he thought there should be no politics on what they do/who they serve and they'd be fine to take military/dictator/police dep't money (this is my own summarizing). So I don't use this either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CON: I don't know. I haven't used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRO: I don't know. I haven't used it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any others I'm overlooking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey, I read your piece on version control. It was interesting, but I think you're overlooking one major alternative that ticks several of the boxes: Self-hosting git. It extremely easy to set up. You need a raspberry pi or any computer with a ssh daemon and git. You do this on the server: &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
cd my-project
git init --bare
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You do this in the client: &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
git  remote add origin git-user@server:my-project
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And that's it. Now you have an off-site backup for your code.  If you want a web interface for sharing your code more publicly, something like gitweb is a good alternative to gitlab and similar, it's much more lightweight (and a bit barebones). See second below for some sample repo I have no affiliation with.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Really liked your most recent post! I've, liked all the ones I've read so far. Real shame seeing that exchange with Drew and makeworld... he always struck me as a bit of an asshole, but this makes me almost want to stop using sourcehut. I guess I could always try to self-host a sourcehut instance. Maybe I should, because if I was in makeworld's shoes I certainly wouldn't have been as level-headed in my responce.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing the machismo toxic masculinity that infects so much of open source / linux and other software communities has been really disappointing. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's definitely one of the worst parts of open source.. I try to remain optimistic that pushback is growing and as our communities become more diverse attitudes like his will be completely unacceptable.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-23&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temporary Services is a 23-year old group made up of artists and cultural workers, based in Illinois, currently made up of Brett Bloom and Marc Fischer and their collaborators. I've known of their work since I was in college in 2004 and worked on a thesis research project and website (now lost) about socially-engaged and critical public art practice. I stumbled across their work online and found it revelatory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://temporaryservices.org"&gt;Temporary Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned they had produced dozens of artist zines with essays, manifestos, exhibits, conversations. They were downloadable as PDFs and available for cheap through mail order distro. I was attracted to Temporary Services's DIY punk ethos of self-publishing and presenting their work in temporary storefronts, informal card tables set up on the street and the like. They produced newspapers of interviews and images that could be unfolded and pasted up as an exhibit. They championed the work of maligned artists, creative practitioners, prisoners and activists. At the time the medium of 'social practice art' was gaining some momentum and becoming more formalized in some corners of the art world, particularly championed by curator Nato Thompson (at Mass MOCA and then at Creative Time art organization) and in some graduate programs like Harrell Fletcher's Public Practice grad program at Portland State University and Ted Purves's Social Practice graduate program at California College of the Arts as well as identified within the work of artists like Mierle Laderman Ukeles, British artist Jeremy Deller, Thomas Hirschorn's Gramsci Monument project, and the public projects of street artist JR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this 'genre' became more normalized to some degree even the commercial art market was inevitably able to commercialize and sell some aspects of it - here I am thinking of Suzanne Lacy's work as just one example: public events treated as performances that are documented as photographs, then sold or presented as installations in galleries. Or the multi-farious mega public practices of Theaster Gates combining performance, social practice, painting and objects for exhibition and sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021 this medium has now been re-integrated into art canon and perhaps it's harder to see it as so distinct from other media anymore as it's become more of the norm for artists to combine disciplines: artist and video maker and photographer and musician and performer. In fact I'd say it might even be more rare at this point for an artist to stick to a single medium (except for painters, lol). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temporary Services never quite fit within this world. They resisted being commodified and went right on producing pamphlets, hosting exhibits at local art spaces in Illinois and occasionally around the country or around the world. They started a press and distribution company Small Letter Press to distribute their own materials and those of friends. They traveled around the country to distribute their works through art book fairs. And they continued to abide by their own goals in one of the most simple, beautiful and powerful manifestos I've ever read and been moved by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/manifesto.jpg" alt="Manifesto poster"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Manifesto poster&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;WE STRIVE TO BUILD AN ART PRACTICE THAT:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes the distinction between art and other forms of creativity irrelevant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Builds and depends upon mutually supportive relationships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tests ideas without waiting for permission or invitation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Champions the work of those who are frequently excluded, under-recognized, marginal, non-commercial, experimental, and/or socially and politically provocative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Puts money and cultural capital back into the work of artists and self-publishers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makes opportunities from large museums and institutions more inclusive by bringing lesser-known artists in through collaborations or advocacy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insists that artists who achieve success devote more time and energy to creating supportive social and economic infrastructure for others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifesto can be found as a printed poster for sale through their distro Half Letter Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creative tools for art-making, community building and publishing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This is aimed at a 'beginner' audience with no previous experience with open source, Linux, programming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: what would tools to make 'art' look like for Gemini? An ascii drawing program I suppose. And maybe a branching narrative gmi software (maybe a fork of Twee/Twine? I'll leave this as an idea worth exploring further possibly in a future post or as an exercise for the reader).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following text comes from a workshop held at ARoS art museum in Denmark, part of ARoS Public, co-organized between Flux Factory, Code &amp;amp; Share [] Aarhus and Cantina art space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/open-source-arts-poster.jpg" alt="Open Source Tools for Artists Poster"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Open Source Tools for Artists Poster&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if all illustrators were required to use the same brand and design of #2 pencils or if all photographers could use only one type of camera and film and pay a monthly fee for their continued use. This is the situation today for todayâs largest (and best-marketed) digital artmaking suites like Adobe Creative Suite. But a whole world of other exciting, experimental and artist-friendly tools exist beyond the confines of this. This workshop on creative tools is built for artists, and small DIY communities, covering possibilities of image production, drawing, photographing, organizing and experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this workshop we will start with a brief overview of artmaking tools that are alternatives to commercial offerings and then launch into a range of many other experimental and exciting artist software tools such as zine making tools (Electric Zine Maker), digital painting software (Krita, JS Paint), painting tools that allow one to collaboratively draw with a computer (NoPaint), 3d object scanning (Meshroom), and many more. Participants will create mini projects with these tools which we will document with photos and screenshots. By the end of the session we will produce a collaborative zine about these tools and showing the work weâve created, with the goal of making this resource available for artists everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Open Source?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration. A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. --source: Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free software communities were part of DIY and university communities. Open Source is a more recent term, and was originally intended for software programs but a movement of artists and creative practitioners creating open source tools and creative works has spread worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-type-in-games-listings"&gt;The rise and fall of type-in game listings &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: People's Computer Company was a newsletter that advocated copyright-free software, the free sharing of code, and artistic and creative exploration via programming, even by beginners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why are artists interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists collaborate, are part of scenes and communities and engage in a flow of ideas. The internet has allowed this flow of ideas and works to flourish across far distances, collapsed within the space of a browser. Increasingly, artists presenting their work online are interested in open source licensing for their creative work. Creative Commons is a long-running set of "copyleft" licenses to enable the free distribution of an artist/author who wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that the author has created. There are a few variations including one version that only allows re-use and remixing for non-commercial purposes. Example: Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike is a license that says anyone is free to share and remix the licensed work as long as they give credit and share their newly created work with the same license permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tens of thousands of creative commons licensed music, for example on the Free Music Archive, millions of creative commons licensed photos on Flickr, and many more sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools for Work and Organizing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll look at tools for organizing and documenting as well as art-making tools. There is a "drop-in" replacement for commercial applications like Google Drive and Microsoft Office Suite called Cryptpad. Its applications include word processing, spreadsheets, slideshow creation, drawing software, Kanban to-do lists, whiteboarding. It does not sell your data; in fact, it features strong encryption. It runs on the phone, and can be used anonymously or saved to an account. You can run it on your own server, or use a hosted option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other major editing tools include Krita (digital painting), Scribus (page layout and design), GIMP (photo image editing), OpenOffice (office suite), Ardour (audio editing), Blender (3d Graphics). The website Alternative To is a good place to look for open source alternatives to commercial software products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Experimental Art-Making Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

 Existing far beyond the commercial confines of a creative suite is the world of experimental and often tiny software tools. This includes software for drawing, photography, sound or other media.

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tools we tried out during our workshop. Hundreds more tools can be found in Everest Pipkin's Tiny Tools Directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting when I began undergrad college and continuing for 15 years I worked in small non-profit arts organizations: these were small art museums or art and performance-presenting organizations. After graduating from undergrad I joined a new residency program with individual studios and shared gallery. I was living at home so the studio and gallery gave me independence and gave me a meeting space and community. A few years later I began working with artist collectives. These were generally groups of 5 - 10 people that collectively had studios and a gallery space, or maybe just the gallery space. The kinds of collectives I've been part of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Let's call this one LB, an artist-run space (about 5 - 10 floating organizers) with monthly exhibits, weekly parties/raves, performance art events, community garden, BBQs, zine library and more (in Philadelphia). I first learned about it when I was on a first or second date with someone and she took me there. I met the organizers, who said they really needed help, and I was game. Soon it came to take over a large part of my life. While running a 'professional' non-profit I put an equal amount of time into organizing the space. But sadly, the space is now closed under the pandemic, and I haven't been part of it for many years since I left that city. Lately I've been in touch with past members and we've been talking about how to 'archive' and preserve the activities, zines and documentation of exhibits. Not technically a legal entity. We did have a shared bank account, kind of like if we were a local baseball team or club. We lived in an area where we as DIY and grassroots artists contributed to a process of gentrification, and soon found ourselves surrounded by new construction, families moving in who couldn't tolerate our late night events, and conflicts with new property developers and the warehouse owner we were located within. The organizers (we called ourselves 'members' or 'curators') were all close, lived within a few blocks of the art space, and it became like a 'third location', our community living room. We met up there every few days at most, even sometimes would sleep there, host bands from out of town. It was a thrilling and fulfilling scene and community. I did everything from curate exhibits and events to writing press releases, killing rats, cleaning the bathroom, painting walls....you get the idea. At this space, most of us understood what we were doing as being part of an anarchist, non-hierarchical space where we had to figure out how to work together and get consensus. We would occasionally have conflicts but ultimately were a pretty functioning and successful space, and had a lot of visibility as an art space in our city. This space / collective existed for about 11 years before it closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. An underground radio station (I'll call it KRadio) that had dozens of DJs and half a dozen rotating volunteer organizers  (in Los Angeles) - still going, but I'm not part of it any longer as I live in New York. I found this organizational model intense and beautiful. A different model of organization and anarchy in action. Due to its huge size in this group many people would float in and out, with many different levels of commitment. There were no elections. You self-nominated for a position. All leadership/organizational positions were rotating or in flux. If you thought something needed to be done, you did it, or talked with others about it and worked together at monthly meetings. Usually 5 to 15 people (out of the 100 or so total DJs / organizers) would show up for monthly meetings. Over time we started also having bar hangout nights. When bands rolled through town or DJs they could come play a live set on air. The radio programs were unpredictable, experimental, like nothing I've heard elsewhere. Interview shows, noise shows, meditation shows, call-in shows, electronic music, reggaeton, tarot readings, a show that re-broadcast found atmospheric radio, etc etc etc. We used email and a public wiki for organization, and some google spreadsheets that fed our website's program schedule. I served as the "Manager Manager" (which also had other names at different times). We generally had a system where program managers would sit at the station for a few hours and help individual DJs get on the air, archive shows, handle technical needs, etc. So I helped organize the calendar so that there were always managers at the station or that we had individual DJs that knew how to self-manage. At first I thought I was going to get frustrated by how certain issues or needs would sometimes get dropped and not dealt with, but I learned to appreciate this anarchist form. Some things didn't need doing, or if they would roll into larger issues then people really would manifest and deal with them. The constant flux of the organization could be un-mooring, but the ability to step in and organize, or to hang back and just be a DJ was a really beautiful process. This group seems to have been mighty affected for the first half of the pandemic, but it seems to be gaining its steam back now, and I tune in occasionally to folks' programs. This collective is about 15 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. An artist-run collective in New York City that I'll call FSpace. This is one of the most 'legit' of the underground DIY groups I've been part of. It's 27 years old, is a non-profit with a functioning board, has a prominent artist residency program, 1 or 2 full time employees and a couple part time employees. Everyone else is a volunteer but often paid for work or receives stipends for art projects or exhibits or workshops. This group's model is really nice. You can become a short term or longterm artist-in-resident or you can float in and out depending on occasional yearly exhibits or programs. As a group, we have a 'family' email list, do at least one in-person monthly dinner and performance night and have public exhibitions. During the pandemic we did online karaoke, figure/life drawing, fashion shows, talks and had exhibits viewable outdoors. In the summer we had block parties. And right now I'm typing this up while being on a residency within a residency. A bunch of us are in another country (Denmark) doing a residency together at a museum. We are staying at a hotel nearby. So even though many of us live in different cities now we have these yearly meetings of intense hang-out and art-making and organizing together that keeps us really gelled as a group, and in many ways it feels like an art family, especially as many of us are in our 30s and 40s and elected not to be part of traditional family structures with children. The org has a director, but we also have many group-led decision-making, and there is a commitment to making things work out financially for the org and for us as individuals, and a lot of transparency. People float in and out as their lives change. We do sometimes have larger challenges to tackle, (issues of inclusion, transparency, normal interpersonal conflict issues) but generally have a positive working method and no bad blood. It's the most 'functional' giant group I've been part of. Most recently this org has purchased its own space, a major accomplishment in such an expensive city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. I'm part of an experimental new media art/video game collective that I'll call BCake. Located in New York City, with a rotating leadership and fairly non-hierarchical leadership model, though there is a separate nominal board of the non-profit entity. There are no full-time employees, maybe a dozen volunteers that help run the space and put together our public programs. This organization has a large online presence through streaming programs throughout the pandemic, and when in-person had weekly exhibits, concerts, performances and other public programs. With this org I've helped write grants, put together educational workshops and an art residency program. We're in the middle of a difficult pandemic with major challenges and some people less committed / interested as we've been online-only for almost a year and a half now. But I think we'll make it through in one piece. This org is about 12 years old. One small but consistent thing we've been doing: holding weekly hangouts for organizers and any other members of our community. No clear agenda other than hanging out, showing what we're working on, watching youtube videos together or making memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these are my crews. As someone that has largely chosen to not have a family I've put my energy into being part of these communities, and feel a ton of support and strength from them. I had a fear that as I got older I may be aged out and feel alien in alternative and DIY spaces but at least so far that hasn't been the case, and I have other people growing older with me as well. Especially as I soon enter my fourth decade it's important to me that I have a supportive chosen family, and while these groups are always in flux it feels like the right amount of family that I need and want. Outside of these groups I have close friends that are not necessarily parts of these groups, but they come to my events or organizing, or come together when I recently had a birthday party picnic for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the 'family' feeling part I also value being part of creative communities. Sometimes we work together collaboratively on art projects but more often we serve as sounding boards, emotional support or in intergenerational mentoring. There's also the aspect of trying to create the world that we want to see exist: the building out and living 'prefigurative politics' of creating the groups/world that we want to be part of. These are generally medium size groups where we know some people closely, intensely, but there are also past or tertiary related folks that we can meet or connect to in more loose ways. The community feels small enough to be close but large enough that there's room for growth and exploration. Importantly, none of these groups are organized around an individual or longterm position of power, and 'founders' or leaders rotate in and out. In many ways they demonstrate anarchy in action. That said, we have to decide how we relate to the wider society and even fit within capitalism and a structurally far different society than the one we want to be located within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these being art collectives I've said little about art. The secret is that the art, while important, it's really the ingredient for us to be drawn together. We are all working on our art, sometimes together. But it's the shared creativity, the shared 'scenius' and shared commitment to supporting each other that binds us. Some of us make video games. Others make experimental 'walks' as performance art. And still others make paintings or zines or films or musical instruments. We will always do this. And we will always (try to) show up on a freezing cold and raining Thursday night to watch 10 people in an iron kitchen chef battle featuring the secret ingredient (cheeze wiz? i can't remember) while a naked announcer MCs from inside a cooking pot-and-makeshift-bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;

*update 2021-08-09: added links2*

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-08&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you love Gemini and want a similar minimalistic blazing fast reading experience for the web without ads and a bunch of other cruft?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few minimal browsers to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveats: I'm trying this on my own system: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and iOS 14. I particularly love: fast loading, good default settings, intuitive controls, fast pageviews, and Vim-keys mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the following list, here's what I personally use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;w3m for CLI web client&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;qutebrowser or falkon on laptop &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;firefox when I need a 'regular' browser;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;violoncello for text-mode browser client on iOS, or Firefox Focus for mostly full-featured&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the amfora client for Gemini. It's fast, intuitive and can be controlled in Vim-mode. So I compare all text internet browsers to amfora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;w3m&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it and like it. Fast. Good color scheme. Vim-mode works by default. Easy to navigate. If you use w3m-gui mode on supporting terminal (Terminology) you can even have embedded images inside the Terminal! Need a text-mode http client? Use this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't use it. Minimal text web client. No colorscheme. Arrow keys work fine. Ultra fast but due to lack of color can be hard to distinguish content sections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lynx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like it. PROS: color scheme is on by default. CONS: Everything else. SLOW! Every time I launch it I have to turn Vi-keys back on. It interrupts every few seconds to ask if I want to approve every. single. cookie. So I have to turn all cookies on or off in the preferences each time I launch it to avoid this. At least colorscheme works well by default, but I find the controls unintuitive. Then I click escape to get to the preferences and see that I can toggle between Novice-Intermediate-Advanced modes, plus a million other controls. Even with Vi-mode I don't have gg or G, so basically, I don't like the out-of-the-box experience and haven't been willing to wade through configuring it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Links2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a suggestion of Kelbot. It's almost as good as w3m! By default I'm finding the color black, but it's very easy to navigate with keys or menus, is easy to read, and is very fast. Recommended. I tested it on the CLI on my iPhone and found it pretty usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GUI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kristall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kristall.random-projects.net/"&gt;Kristall browser/client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's made for Gemini but can also load markdown, gopher, http, finger....It's fast. You can create your own simple stylesheet. Recommended. I like it but rarely use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Falkon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.falkon.org/"&gt;Falkon browser client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast! Looks like a 'real' browser. Loads quickly and navigates easily. Aesthetics get out of the way and just let me do my own thing. I just learned about it recently but I really like it so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;surf&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://surf.suckless.org/"&gt;surf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly fast. Works okay even in tiny window. No JS. No tabs. Not much to it. Suckless software. Launched from CLI. I use it (since it's the default) on my PocketChip computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dillo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dillo.org/"&gt;Dillo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast. A little clunky. Has an early 90s interface aesthetic, which makes sense since it was started in 1999. Allows HTML, some CSS, no javascript. Features bookmarks, tabs and support for images. Some pages are rendered a bit funky. Built on GTK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;qutebrowser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://qutebrowser.org/"&gt;qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast. Feels pretty full-featured. Keyboard-driven (vim-like). qt-webkit and qt-webengine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Violoncello (iOS and Android)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tectrasystems.violoncello"&gt;violoncello on google play store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/violoncello/id1568931107"&gt;Violoncello on iOS app store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it! Free. Or pay $1 to be able to change font, background color and text color (that's it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app is only a month old. It works well. It's lightning fast. It's more than just a readability clone but I'm not sure how exactly. Maybe it just renders HTML and some light readability overlay. Anyway, I like reading with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rhapsode (Voice User Interface client)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rhapsode.adrian.geek.nz/"&gt;Rhapsode client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A voice-controlled browser for the web. I have no experience using this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="."&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-04&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a MFA but I don't draw particularly well. They are sketchy skribbles at best. But that is okay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. I enjoy drawing as a process, and I enjoy my sketches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Everyone can do drawing or make art. Art is not only for 'experts' or virtuosos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. I can't be good at everything or even many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. There is no single definition of 'good'. Most photorealistic drawing, as just one example, bores me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I made a very simple drawing program for use in a web browser, meant to be called from within vimwiki so that I can do a quick sketch and save it inline in my wiki. Because the software works in a browser and is so simple it works on a phone or tablet or my laptop. I've been sketching with it for the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/donovan.png" alt="A sketch of Donovan during Zoom co-working, made on laptop"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A sketch of Donovan during Zoom co-working, made on laptop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/table.png" alt="Still life of cafe table, made on laptop"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Still life of cafe table, made on laptop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/nephew.jpg" alt="Nephew, made on tablet"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Nephew, made on tablet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/interview.jpg" alt="Drawing based on photo, made on tablet"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Drawing based on photo, made on tablet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;img src="images/beer.jpg" alt="Loose sketch of beer bottle on my dresser, made on phone"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Loose sketch of beer bottle on my dresser, made on phone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not build in 'saving' features. You can screenshot or click and save canvas. You'll see part of the UI in several of the screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my degree, I like to think many of my art-making processes are self-taught or peer-taught or learned from a book or workshop or youtube video. My sketching is intuitive and amateur. I may integrate it into my 3d and digital processes. Or it may stay as just a sketching practice. And either way, that's okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="."&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-08-04&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you played a solo tabletop roleplaying game? I live alone in a studio apartment. During the pandemic there have been weeks where I couldn't really see anyone else in-person. But I love playing games and don't always want to be on my computer. I don't have much previous experience with solo tabletop roleplaying games but I found a few popping up on Itch.io suggestions and donated for a few. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How they work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've come across two types of solo games: those emphasizing story-creation and those emphasizing mechanics or mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don't know if most of them work this way but the vast majority I've come across seem to mostly revolve around a kind of solo story-making process. This makes sense to me, as I think of tabletop roleplaying games as collaboratively shared and created stories. Rather than you the sole player responding to other player's actions, as a solo player you use some prompts, sometimes generated by dice rolls or cards and the like, as the seed to spark the next part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some solo games I enjoyed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Adventurer &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by James Chip&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jameschip.io/games/the_adventurer.html"&gt;The Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was the first and my favorite solo ttrpg so far. In fact, it's the only one I've played twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The adventure is a journal writing game for a single player. During the game you will be creating a world and filling it with it's own people, traditions and folklore by journaling your characters adventures in it. All you need to play is something to log your journey in and a standard deck of playing cards. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jameschip.io/adventurer_online"&gt;Card picker for The Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played this twice, for about an hour each time. James does a really good job of setting the scene with his pdf booklet including instructions, setting up something that feels like a ritual. His minimal hand-drawing digital drawings also help with the mood. He also gives just the right amount of suggestion to let my mind take over and create the story. If you get stuck, there is a way to play with an optional tool called 'The Oracle' that he details. James explains how one might want to deviate from the rules. This all made me feel welcome to try this out, explore or modify the 'rules' and see what comes. I recommend this as a good first solo ttrpg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Alone in the Ancient City&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Takuma Okada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://noroadhome.itch.io/alone-in-the-ancient-city"&gt;Alone in the Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A tabletop roleplaying game about exploring the many districts of a vast and ancient city. Uses a standard 52 card deck and a six-sided die. For 1+ players.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a modification of a previous solo ttrpg game called Alone Among the Stars but I didn't find that theme as compelling. In this game you play as an adventurer. You write essentially a journal, give a bit of a back story, and then through randomly selected cards of a deck choose locations and actions that take place. Perhaps you have come across a person, or you've jus arrived in a new place. You get to decide the details and write them down in a story-like diary entry. This was one of the first of these that I tried, and I enjoyed the process, 'playing' for about 45 minutes perhaps. I also often do like semi-daily web-based coding as an continual art practice, and that evening I created a random card selector program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://leetusman.com/everyday/129/"&gt;Card selector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Long Walk Home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Monte Monteleagre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://fungif" alt="ungius.itch.io/a-long-walk-home A Long Walk Home"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;ungius.itch.io/a-long-walk-home A Long Walk Home&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A business card sized RPG about finding home. Generate a map over any flat surface with a handful of six-sided dice and journal about your travels across this new world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the previous game, but this one was even simpler. I played it on another evening. I played this one for a shorter time period. I enjoyed it but I had trouble stretching my mind to fill out the scene. I have limited ability to picture things in my mind (aphantasia), which I think made it hard for me to fully describe a town or scene that I couldn't see that wasn't already somewhat described to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dungeon Mountain: Song of the Mountain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Ghost Glyph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ghostglyph.itch.io/dungeon-mountain-song-of-the-mountain"&gt;Dungeon Mountain: Song of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Song of The Mountain, you play as an explorer attempting to find the secret Song of The Mountain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the games mentioned previously emphasized solo story creation I found this game to be more about rolling up a randomly generated 2d dungeon map, like a roguelike video game, then playing through it. This game was a hack by the creator of their own previous multi-player dungeon exploration game. I found the map-making compelling and enjoyed sketching this little maze-like. While playing you have little battles with NPC-like situations, and there is some strategy, but also enough room to cheat or forget where you are at. I was confused at one or two things and just found a way to make things work. Ultimately it felt like the game needed more balancing since the story was de-emphazied and the randomness of your dice rolls effected the outcome of your game. In many ways it acts like a solo version of Forbidden Island or Forbidden Desert cooperative board games, if you're familiar with those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136063/forbidden-desert"&gt;Forbidden Desert on Board Game Geek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Shopkeeper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Not A Pipe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://microfictiongames.neocities.org/2020/shopkeeper.html"&gt;Shopkeeper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are a village shopkeeper. Sketch map of area and your shop. Roll d6. You sell 1. plant 2. medicinal herb 3. liquid 4. mineral 5. scent 6. artifact. Sketch item. Log: Describe a customer, a price, did you haggle? What will they use it for? Repeat until you close for the day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created for the Micro Fiction Game Jam, organized by James Chip, linked below. All game descriptions must fit within the size of a tweet. I wrote this prompt, then played it. I draw the shop, then wrote a little journal / register of the shopkeeper. I played for about 30 minutes and enjoyed it. Thinking I may play it again. Or make an interactive digital version where you draw and it saves your drawings and writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More collections of Games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/your-move-jam"&gt;Your Move Jam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://microfictiongames.neocities.org/"&gt;Microfiction Games Jam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The micro fiction games jam is intended to be a yearly game jam where people write and submit very short format games, on a theme, just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="."&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-07-20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's anything that open source programmers love to write about  it's their own personal software choices.  I've written previously on what software I use on Tildes and on my Alpine Linux on my phone use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's my own personal software tools that I use regularly (lol) and some that I wasn't the creator of but have contributed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are generally small little tools meant to run in the terminal or in the web browser as those are the two 'platforms' I usually am building for. My coding is generally fairly minimalist, not necessarily in terms of system resources (though that is often true as well) but more in terms of engineering complexity. Most of these are wrappers or 50 lines of code or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;bookmobile (fish, Node.js)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially a wrapper around Mozilla's Readability web reader-mode and pandoc. This little program pulls down a given URL, cleans out any headers, footers and other cruft and then converts it to beautiful, minimal html, markdown and epub files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/bookmobile"&gt;on tildegit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Minilog (fishscript)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tiny fishscript program to keep a minimal log/diary on the computer. Very similar to the Tinylog movement on Gemini except that it's stored personally, not meant for a public audience. No tagging, time-recording or other metadata beyond the date is recorded by default. I usually run this near the end of the day and enjoy jumping back months at a time (or longer) to see what I was doing or thinking on a certain day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/minilog"&gt;Minilog on tildegit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;vwscratchpad (p5.js / Javascript)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally created to add a scratchpad functionality to my vimwiki personal wiki on my laptop but since it's javascript I pushed it to a hidden spot on my website so I can use it on my phone and tablet. So I've been using it as a personal (weird) sketching app, then saving or screenshotting. Output is sketchy indeed. For example this weekend on a ferry trip I sketched my fellow passengers on my phone while riding on the bumpy seas, which complemented the rocking waves. A good app for sketching in a checkout line, subway, ferry, airplane, or in Vim!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/vwscratchpad"&gt;vwscratchpad on tildegit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gemstats (fishscript)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short fishscript program to display the number of readers of my gemini capsule from the current day, past month, and of all time. Reports same for the Ctrl-C Club tilde server overall. Written about previously here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/gemstats"&gt;Gemstats on tildegit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;minimal-uni (Jekyll ruby-gem)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Jekyll (static site builder) template that I have been using for the past two years to build class websites for my courses I'm teaching. In addition to being very simple and minimal it's also mobile-responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/lee2sman/minimal-uni"&gt;Minimal Uni jekyll template on Github. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;panblog (Bash)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimal Bash blogging pipeline built around pandoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/panblog"&gt;Panblog on tildegit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Geminut (Node.js)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="geminut.html"&gt;Geminut, a Gemini -&amp;gt; HTML markdown converter built for my own needs in Node.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Programs I've Contributed To&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are programs I use that I didn't build but have made small contributions to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Amfora &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contributed the Slimey theme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been an advisor, bug reporter, mentor on several p5.js libraries and on core functionality. I use p5 for much of my own experimental generative web art explorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://p5js.org/"&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;tldr&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've contributed several "collaborative cheatsheets" to this massive resource. It's made my CLI experience so much more pleasant. I love always having the ability get simple no-nonsense CLI suggestions for programs, especially ones I've just downloaded or rarely use. Much better than Man-pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021-07-18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I participated in List Jam, organized by Em Reed on Itch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/list-jam"&gt;List Jam 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/list-jam/entries"&gt;Entries to List Jam 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contribution was called A List of Games I'd Like to Play And/Or Make. And here it is below. I've also noted a few examples of some of these that were actually made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a command line text-game where you wander between different villages with a donkey. You are trying to buy ~~silks~~ textiles. Like Dopewars? When you are successful, you return home to a feast. High chance of failure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;update: I made this in March 2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notapipe.itch.io/gobi"&gt;Gobi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a hand drawn black and white (charcoal? pencil?) and scanned in assets. You are wandering around a bombed-out post-apocalyptic landscape, but plants are taking back over (kudzu?). There are old broken bits of technology, like old keyboards and ethernet cables that you can find occasionally. At some point you find a gameboy and turn it on. It still works and you can play little games on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A game where you have to fill out generated grants and artists statements with your wildest ideas. Each form and RPF is different. But when you submit, there is some chance your grant will be *accepted* (maybe it depends on number of questions what your chances are?). Fireworks shoot off when one of your grants is accepted and your score increases by one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A game where you are pushing a katamari ball and you roll up and remove cars from the street. Eventually you are big enough to roll up McMansions, police departments, prisons, corporations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a videogame where you read a book&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a videogame at the north (south?) pole. Made up of generated pokey the penguin characters and dialog and quests that don't need to be done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A roguelike where you play a monster trying to kill the player. When you get killed you are reincarnated as the next monster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;~~A twine game version of Passage.~~ (update: nevermind - I no longer want to platform Jason Rohrer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;~~a 2d videogame where i am the main character and i live in a treehouse with lots of cats~~&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an actual paper rad x corey arcangel homebrew nintendo game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a video game where you play as slime mold&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a videogame where the "screen" you are playing on is a strip of lightbulbs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a chess game that slowly unfolds with input via a blood sugar monitor. If I keep my blood sugar in check, my player (AI-controlled) is a bit "smarter" and does better. As I'm spiking or dropping, my AI makes bad moves against the opponent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a roguelike played on the Monome Teletype that produces musical output as you battle and explore. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;games that fit in the size of a tweet. any language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a text game where you travel through rural parts of northern thailand, burma and laos that includes music from tribes of the region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a 3d game where the player is black hole that absorbs an entire IKEA &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a videogame that you play with your nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;i think it would be cool to have a game played with a controller made out of bread. maybe some kind of cooking game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;lots of personalized remakes of Muscle March (the GREATEST videogame of all time)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a donkey kong country mine cart level maker/generator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;make games where you can play the radio and change stations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a choose your own adventure played with morse code audio and a code keyer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game like rock band except that it's a jazz quartet playing a simple 1-4-5 blues progression and you're playing keyboard accompaniment while NPCs take turns soloing. you have a midi keyboard controller and nothing bad happens if you hit off notes other than it may sound bad to you. it should have a bunch of fake book songs to choose from, slow blues, and the sounds of glasses clinking and clapping after solos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game where you collect snipped out letters and then compose a ransom note. it tells you who the ransom note should be written for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a remake of the mac plus helicopter drop game. needs some good music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game that asks you to list 15 or 20 ingredients from your kitchen at the beginning, and when you finally win or lose it, it produces a recipe for you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game based on Caves of Qud style graveyards. All you do is walk around explore the tombstones and epitaphs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a shared online radio station you can DJ with your friends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;write a text adventure game based on the box art of the original Mastermind game. (okay, you can have a version of the original game played within the text game as well).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a series of oulipo text games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dungeon Painter. whatever that is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game that can be played and experienced in google forms. *update: [time tossed](http://slimedaughter.com/games/twine/timetossed/) by porpentine*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game for that fancy ipod-like vape that comes with the game Simon. do they still have that? can you hack the firmware? *[update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAt7wfiNOdE)*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an interactive audio-based exercise game that you play maybe on a phone, like the zombies run game but the story is interesting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game where you draw all the rooms from your childhood home. you can add yourself as a playable character if you want. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually did make this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notapipe.itch.io/232henley"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game where robotic legs can try on many different silly shoes and you get to see how it affects their walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Qwoperpillar - a qwop-like but with 20 legs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mario Teaches Cooking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Felicia's Pizza (where i worked in high school) made in the Hotline Miami level editor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9 men's morris played live (not turn-based) by 2 teams. Games will probably last just a few seconds?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a chess RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game you play by going to sleep. when you wake up you look to see how well your character did, read about their adventure, qquests, treasure gained, monsters fought, etc. Your character has greater chance of success and riches based on getting closest to adequate amount of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a Tamagotchi based on my exercising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;more games where you assemble scrap quilt parts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;write back stories for all the characters in the boring Spades game I have on my iPad. What's their story? How did they come to be playing this game?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a LOGO-like where you can control the character in a roguelike game only by issuing instruction code. you have to write your own movement and action and combat functions and use them when you're not hungry. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;update: this is actually how most kids' "learn to program" environments are made now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a simple grid-based level editor. You can click to place enemies, power ups, potions, weapons and add the player. click to try the level, and a button to export or share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;more games that are based on or use the Talmud&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a really crappy trippy weird reimplementation of Carmen Sandiego&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a really crappy digital CLAW machine game where the prizes are generated and if you successfully grab one it gets added to your inventory and displayed on the desktop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an adventure game (collaborative or solo) played on a chalkboard, whiteboard or post-it notes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a drawing app where there is an occasional sound affect playing from the original NBA Jam as you draw. ("Perfect!", "He's on fire!","Is it the shoes?!")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;10,000 bowls of oatmeal, the game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game where you design or select a simple flag, motto, food, drink, flower favored in each village and then see how civilization plays out and cultures combine and influence each other&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a game where you collect and read library books. there should be a large number of books (from project gutenberg?) and nooks to read in. actually, maybe the virtual nook should drop away and the while the character reads the book on the screen you should mostly just have the ebook available for you to read in your own real nook somewheres&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what if the mechanics of the NES space vikings game had gone on to become a canon genre of games and there were clones and variations of it available on every platform?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;no more plant simulation games. get actual plants. jeez.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;more games like robot finds kitten&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;root beer as possible inventory item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3d open world game but it's raining a ton, like Seattle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;text game but in toki pona&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a LOGO-like where the player issues the normal commands to move around and turn but also can augment and add arms, legs, other appendages like tank treads and strange abilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./"&gt;back to index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
