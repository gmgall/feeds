&lt;p&gt;A bit of background about myself, first. I use Void Linux, write code (and all files) in neovim and started my programming journey with Python. Well, technically I started with &lt;a href="https://scratch.mit/edu"&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;. Scratch is &lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt; visual block-based programming playground. Things that make beginners scratch their heads in confusion, like multiple threads and manipulating a gui are accessible in Scratch from the click of a button. Once I had decided to learn a ârealâ language, the internet told me to learn Python, and I obliged. I admire Python a lot. Even when I was oblivious to most of it I was somewhat aware that Python covered up most of the âweirdnessâ that one may find in a lower-level language. However recently I have found myself longing for something moreâ¦ â ## In comes Rust Rust looked like just what I wanted: * More performant than Python * A really helpful, readable compiler * Lower-level, which means more control and learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, about a week ago, I started learning Rust. Iâm taking it slowly, creeping my way through the Rust Book and doing practise projects along the way. When November 1st comes Iâll continue learning, and try and utilise some of my gained knowledge to create a simple app in rust for the yh4f event. What the app is? Youâll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
